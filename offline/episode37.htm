Slow pan across idyllic countryside. We see a traditional eighteenth-century coach and horses travelling along the valley floor. Suddenly a highwayman, Dennis Moore, spurs his horse forward and rides up to the coach brandishing pistols.</I>

<FONT ID=John>Stand and deliver! Drop that gun! <I>(the coach comes to a halt; the drivers hold up their hands but a postillion reaches for a gun; Moore shoots him)</I> Let that be a warning to you all. You move at your peril, for I have two pistols here. I know one of them isn't loaded any more, but the other one is, so that's one of you dead for sure...or just about for sure anyway. It certainly wouldn't be worth your while risking it because I'm a very good shot. I practice every day...well, not absolutely <EM>every</EM> day, but most days in the week...I expect I must practice, oh, at least four or five times a week at least...at least four or five, only some weekends...like last weekend, there really wasn't the time, so that moved the average down a bit...but I should say it's definitely a solid four days' practice a week...at least. I mean...I reckon I could hit that tree over there...the one just behind that hillock...not the big hillock, the little hillock on the left. <I>(heads are coming out of the coach and peering)</I> You see the three trees, the third from the left and back a bit - that one - I reckon I clould hit that four times out of five...on a good day.

<FONT ID=Eric>Well it may be the end of that, but it's certainly far from the end of - well in fact it's the beginning - well not quite the beginning - well certainly nearer the beginning than the end - well yes damn it, it is to all intents and purposes the beginning of this year's Ideal Loon Exhibition, sponsored by the 'Daily Express'. <I>(cut to interior of hall, people pouring through the doors; above their heads it says 'Ideal Loon Exhibition)</I> Numbskulls and boobies from all over the country have been arriving to go through their strange paces before a large paying crowd. This is the fifteenth Ideal Loon Exhibition and we took a good look round after it was opened by its patron ... <I>(quick flash of Edward Heath opening something)</I> There's Kevin Bruce the digger duffer from down-under, who's ranked fourteenth in the world's silly positions league... <I>(Kevin is in a roped-off exhibition area; with a number in front of him; people are walking past looking at him with programmes; he is dressed in Australian bush gear and he is leaning his forehead against a goldfish bowl on a four-foot-six plinth)</I> This kind of incoherent behaviour is really beginning to catch on down-under. There's Norman Kirby from New Zealand, whose speciality is standing behind a screen with a lady with no clothes on ... <I>(again in an exhibition stand with a number in front; there is a screen which is higher than their heads, but it is cut off at knee height so you can see two pairs of legs, one female, totally bare, one male wearing some enormous boots, no socks)</I> In real life, Norman is a gynaecologist, but this is his lunch hour. And from France there's a superb exhibition of rather silly behaviour by the Friends of the Free French Osteopaths. <I>(on the stand five men dressed in Breton berets, striped French shirts, silly moustaches, with baguettes; in unison they make the silly sign, counting the while 'un, deux, trois')</I> They do this over four hundred times a day. Nobody knows why. But for sheer pointless behaviour you've got to admire Brian Broomers, the battling British boy who for two weeks has been suspended over a tin of condemned veal. <I>(quite a crowd watch this; again a roped-off exhibit, Brian (Graham) is suspended from the ceilling by two car tyres; he lies there smoking a pipe; underneath him there is a small opened tin, with 'veal' on the side)</I> Always popular with the crowd, is the Scotsman with Nae Trews exhibit, and this year's no exception. <I>(a very large man (John) dressed as a Scotsman in front of a sign saying 'Scotsman with Nae Trews Exhibit, Sponsored by Natural Gas'; an enormously long line of middle-aged pepperpots stand waiting in a queue; eath in turn lifts up a comer of Scotsman's kilt, has a tiny peek and walks off)</I> Sponsored by Natural Gas and Glasgow City Council, this exhibit is entirely supported by voluntary contributions. But for a truly magnificent waste of time you've got to go no further than the exhibit from Italy - Italian priests in custard, discussing vital matters of the day. <I>(four Italian priests standing up to their chests in a large vat of custard; in front of them it says 'Italian Priests in custard'; they are animatedly discussing vital matters; hung behind them is a sign saying 'Italy, Land of Custard')</I> These lads from a seminary near Cremona, have been practising for well over a year. As always one of the great attractions of this fourteen-day exhibition is the display of counter-marching given by the Massed Pipes and Toilet Requisites of the Colwyn Bay Massed Pipes and Toilet Requisites Club. <I>(a dozen people in blazers, flannels and white pumps are vigorously counter-marching, whilst Souza's Star Spangled Banner blares out; they are holding various items of plumbing, lengths of piping, a toilet, a bidet, a bath, back scrubbers, loofahs, shower attachments, hand basins, etc.)</I> An interesting point about these boys is they all have one thing in common. Hip injuries. Not far away the crowds are flocking to see a member of the famous Royal Canadian Mounted Geese. <I>(cut to pantomime goose on horseback)</I> But the climax of the whole event is the judging.</FONT>

<FONT ID=Michael>Tonight's show comes live from the tiny village of Rabid in Buckinghamshire, and our first question tonight is from a Mrs Elizabeth Scrint who says she is going on a Mediterranean cruise next week and can't find anything wrong with the Syrians. Well, Mrs Scrint, apart from being totally unprincipled left-wing troublemakers, the Syrians are also born skivers, they're dirty, smelly and untrustworthy, and, of course, they're friends of the awful gippos. <I>(applause)</I> There you are, Mrs Scrint, I hope that answers some of your problems - have a nice trip. <I>(more applause)</I> Well now, the result of last week's competition when we asked you to find a derogatory term for the Belgians. Well, the response was enormous and we took quite a long time sorting out the winners. There were some very clever entries. Mrs Hatred of Leicester Said 'let's not call them anything, let's just ignore them' ... <I>(applause starts vigorously, but he holds his hands up for silence)</I> ... and a Mr St John of Huntingdon said he couldn't think of anything more derogatory than Belgians. <I>(cheers and applause; a girl in showgirl costume comes on and holds up placards through next bit)</I> But in the end we settled on three choices: number three ... the Sprouts <I>(placard 'The Sprouts')</I>, sent in by Mrs Vicious of Hastings... very nice ; number two..... the Phlegms <I>(placard)</I> ... from Mrs Childmolester of Worthing; but the winner was undoubtedly from Mrs No-Supper-For-You from Norwood in Lancashire... Miserable Fat Belgian Bastards. <I>(placard; roar of applause)</I> Very good - thank you, Carol. <I>(Carol exits)</I> But as you know on this programme we're not just prejudiced against race or colour, we're also prejudiced against - yes, you've guessed, stinking homosexuals! <I>(applause)</I> So before the streets start emptying in Chelsea tonight, Let's go straight over to our popular prejudiced panel game and invite you once again to - Shoot The Poof! And could our first contestant sign in please.</FONT>
