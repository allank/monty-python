<FONT ID=John>Penguins, yes, penguins. What relevance do penguins have to the furtherance of medical science? Well, strangely enough quite a lot, a major breakthrough, maybe. It was from such an unlikely beginning as an unwanted fungus accidentally growing on a sterile plate that Sir Alexander Fleming gave the world penicillin. James Watt watched an ordinary household kettle boiling and conceived the potentiality of steam power. Would Albert Einstein ever have hit upon the theory of relativity if he hadn't been clever? All these tremendous leaps forward have been taken in the dark. Would Rutherford ever have split the atom if he hadn't tried? Could Marconi have invented the radio if he hadn't by pure chance spent years working at the problem? Are these amazing breakthroughs ever achieved except by years and years of unremitting study? Of course not. What I said earlier about accidental discoveries must have been wrong. Nevertheless scientists believe that these penguins, these comic flightless web-footed little bastards may finally unwittingly help man to fathom the uncharted depths of the human mind.

<FONT ID=Eric>And we'll be inviting them to... Spot the Loony. <I>(a phone rings on the desk; he picks it up)</I> Yes? Quite right ... A viewer from Preston there who's pointed out correctly that the entire panel are loonies. Five points to Preston there, and on to our first piece of film. It's about mountaineering and remember you have to... Spot the Loony!</FONT>

<I>In the middle distance are two bushes a few yards apart. At this point a loony dressed in a long Roman toga, with tam o'shanter, holding a cricket bat, runs from one bush to the other. Loud buzz. The film freezes. Pull out from screen to reveal the freeze frame of the film with the loony in the middle bush on the screen immediately behind the presenter. The presenter is on the phone.</I>

<FONT ID=Eric>Yes, well done, Mrs Nesbitt of York, spotted the loony in 1.8 seconds. <I>(cut to stock fiilm of Women's Institute applauding)</I> On to our second round, and it's photo time. We're going to invite you to look at photographs of Tony Jacklin, Anthony Barber, Edgar Allan Poe, Katy Boyle, Reginald Maudling, and a loony. All you have to do is ... Spot the Loony! <I>(cut to a photo of Anthony Barber; the buzzer goes immediately)</I> No ... I must ask you please not to ring in until you've seen all the photos.</FONT>
</TD></TR>

<I>Back to the photo sequence and music. Each photo is on the screen for only two seconds, and in between each there is a click as of a slide projector changing or even the sound of the shutter of a camera. The photos show in sequence: Anthony Barber, Katy Boyle, Edgar Allan Poe, a loony head and shoulders. He has ping-pong ball eyes, several teeth blocked out, a fright wig and his chest is bare but across it is written 'A Loony', Reginald Maudling, Tony Jacklin. A buzzer sounds.</I>

</TD><TD>
<FONT ID=Eric>Yes, you're right. The answer was, of course, number two! <I>(cut to stock film of Women's Institute applauding)</I> I'm afraid there's been an error in our computer. The correct answer should of course have been number four, and not Katy Boyle. Katy Boyle is not a loony, she is a television personality. <I>(fanfare as for historical pageant; a historical-looking shield comes up on screen)</I> And now it's time for 'Spot the Loony, historical adaptation'. <I>(historical music)</I> And this time it's the thrilling medieval romance 'Ivanoe'... a stirring story of love and war, violence and chivalry, set midst the pageantry and splendour of thirteenth-century England. All you have to do is, 'Spot the Loony'.</FONT>

<I>Cut to a butcher shop. A loony stands in the middle <I>(this is the same loony from 'Silly Election' with enormous trousers and arms inside them and green fright wig)</I>. Another loony in a long vest down to his knees with a little frilly tutu starting at the knees and bare feet is dancing with a side of beef also wearing a tutu. Another loony in oilskins with waders and sou'wester and fairy wings is flying across the top of picture. Another man dressed us a bee is standing on the counter. Another loony is dressed as a carrot leaning against the counter going: 'pretty boy, pretty boy'. A cocophony of noise. We see this sight for approximately five seconds. Fantastic loud buzzes.</I>
