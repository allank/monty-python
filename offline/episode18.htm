And now for the first item this evening on the Menu - ha ha - the team have chosen as a little hors d'oeuvres an item - and I think we can be sure it won't be an ordinary item - in fact the team told me just before the show that anything could happen, and probably would - so let's have ... the item.</FONT>

<I>Cut to the word 'Blackmail' in letters four feet high, picked out in lightbulbs which flash on and off. Big showbiz music crashes in. Camera pulls back to reveal glittery showbiz set. A presenter in glittery showbiz jacket sits behind a glittery desk, with a telephone on it.</I>

SUPERIMPOSED FLASHING CAPTION: 'STOP THE FILM'
</TD></TR>
<TR valign="top"><TD>
Presenter
</TD><TD>
<FONT ID=Michael>The rules are very simple. We have taken a film which contains compromising scenes and unpleasant details, which could wreck a man's career. But, the victim may phone me at any point and stop the film. But remember the money increases as the film goes on. So the longer you leave it...the more you have to pay! So now, with the clock at &#163;300 this week 'Stop the Film' visited Thames Ditton...</FONT>
</TD></TR>
<TR valign="top"><TD>
</TD><TD>
<I>The following film is shot in murky 8mm. As the film progresses we have a &#163; sign with numerals in one corner which increase. Shot of a residental street in Thames Ditton (sic). Another section of a street with a figure in a Robin Hood hat and raincoat - in the distance on the far side of the road, so we can't really make him out. Cut to slightly closer shot of him about to cross the road. Cut to suburban house. The man is standing at the door pressing the bell and looking round rather furtively. Again shot from some distance and over a hedge. Cut back to studio. The presenter looking at a monitor and then at a phone. Back to the film: a woman opens the door. She wears a dressing gown over lingerie. A shaky zoom in to reveal her clothing. Wide shot of the house with door shut. Jump cut to shot obviously taken from a window in the house. Shaky zoom in on window. We can see in the window...both the man and woman enter the bedroom. He goes out of shot, taking his coat off. Cut back to studio.</I>

</TD><TD>
<FONT ID=Michael>He's being very brave here...</FONT>
</TD></TR>
<TR valign="top"><TD>
</TD><TD>
<I>Cut back to the film: even closer perhaps of window. A series of short jump cuts. She is undressing. She throws off her dressing gown. A jump and she's taking off her negligee. Underneath she wears black corsets. She produces a whip and seems to be beckoning to the man. Phone rings. Cut back to the studio. The presenter picks up the phone.</I>

<FONT ID=Michael>Hello, sir, hello, yes. No sir, no, I'm sure you didn't. No, it's all right, sir, we don't morally censure, we just want the money....Yes, and here's the address to send it to:</FONT>

<I>Cut to a hallway in which a middle-aged man in dinner dress is putting down the telephone rather furtively. He leaves the booth and goes through a door into a large room where a banquet is in progress. There are tables on three sides of a square and he joins the head table which faces as it were downstage. He sits beside other middle-aged and rather elderly men all of whom are the city of London ex-public school type. As he sits, the toastmaster standing behind speaks.</I>

<TR valign="top"><TD>
</TD><TD>
<I>There is much upperclass applause and banging on the table as Sir William rises to his feet.</I>
</TD></TR>
<TR valign="top"><TD>
Sir William
</TD><TD>
<FONT ID=Graham>I thank you, gentlemen. The year has been a good one for the Society <I>(hear, hear)</I>. This year our members have put more things on top of other things than ever before. But, I should warn you, this is no time for complacency. No, there are still many things, and I cannot emphasize this too strongly, <EM>not</EM> on top of other things. I myself, on my way here this evening, saw a thing that was not on top of another thing in any way. <I>(shame!)</I> Shame indeed but we must not allow ourselves to become too despondent. For, we must never forget that if there was not one thing that was not on top of another thing our society would be nothing more than a meaningless body of men that had gathered together for no good purpose. But we flourish. This year our Australasian members and the various organizations affiliated to our Australasian branches put no fewer than twenty-two things on top of other things. <I>(applause)</I> Well done all of you. But there is one cloud on the horizon. In this last year our Staffordshire branch has not succeeded in putting one thing on top of another <I>(shame!)</I>. Therefore I call upon our Staffordshire delegate to explain this weird behaviour.</FONT>
</TD></TR>
<TR valign="top"><TD>
</TD><TD>
<I>As Sir William sits a meek man rises at one of the side tables.</I>
</TD></TR>
<TR valign="top"><TD>
Mr Cutler
</TD><TD>
<FONT ID=John>Er, Cutler, Staffordshire. Um ... well, Mr Chairman, it's just that most of the members in Staffordshire feel... the whole thing's a bit silly.</FONT>
</TD></TR>
<TR valign="top"><TD>

<I>Cries of outrage. Chairman leaps to feet.</I>

<TR valign="top"><TD>
Sir William
</TD><TD>
<FONT ID=Graham>Silly! SILLY!! <I>(he pauses and thinks)</I> Silly! I suppose it is, a bit. What have we been doing wasting our lives with all this nonsense? <I>(hear, hear)</I> Right, okay, meeting adjourned for ever.</FONT>
</TD></TR>
<TR valign="top"><TD>
</TD><TD>
<I>He gets right up and walks away from the table to approving noises and applause. He walks to a door at the side of the studio set and goes through it. Exterior shot: a door opens and Sir William appears out of it into the fresh air. He suddenly halts.</I>
</TD></TR>
<TR valign="top"><TD>
Sir William
</TD><TD>
<FONT ID=Graham>Good Lord. I'm on film. How did that happen?</FONT>
</TD></TR>

<FONT id=John>Oh, er, there you are. Hello. You got the note, jolly good. Well, um, that's all the items that we have for you this week and er, what a jolly nice lot of items too, eh? Um...well, the same team will be back with you again next week with another menu full of items. Um...I don't know if I shall be introducing the show next week as I understand my bits in this show have not been recieved quite as well as they might <I>(start to roll credits over this)</I> but er, never mind, the damage is done - no use in crying over spilt milk. <I>(miserably)</I> I've had my chance and I've muffed it. Anyway, there we are. I'm not really awfully good with words. You see, I'm more of a visual performer. I have a very funny - though I say so myself - very funny funny walk. I wish I'd been in that show. I'd have done rather well. But anyway, there we are - the show's over. And...we'll all be - <EM>they'll</EM> all be back with you again next week... <I>(starting to cry)</I> Sorry. I do beg your pardon. I don't like these...displays of emotion...I wish it would say the end.</FONT>
