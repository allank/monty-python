<FONT ID=TerryJ>Mr Larch, you heard the case for the prosecution. Is there anything you wish to say

Prisoner
</TD><TD>
<FONT ID=Eric>Well... I'd just like to say, m'lud, I've got a family... a wife and six kids... and I
hope very much you don't have to take away my freedom... because... well, because m'lud
freedom is a state much prized within the realm of civilized society. <I>(slips into Olivier
impression)</I> It is a bond wherewith the savage man may charm the outward hatchments of his
soul, and soothe the troubled breast into a magnitude of quiet. It is most precious as a
blessed balm, the saviour of princes, the harbinger of happiness, yea, the very stuff and pith of
all we hold most dear. What frees the prisoner in his lonely cell, chained within the bondage
of rude walls, far from the owl of Thebes? What fires and stirs the woodcock in his springe or
wakes the drowsy apricot betides? What goddess doth the storm toss'd mariner offer her
most tempestuous prayers to? Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!</FONT>

A cartoon advertising 'Interesting Lives' leads to film of milkman (Michael) delivering milk to a suburban house. As he puts the milk down, the front door opens and a seductively dressed young lady (Carol) beckons him inside. Glancing round furtively he follows her into the house and up the stairs. She leads him to the bedroom door, opens it, and ushers him inside, closing the door behind him. Inside, he is bewildered to see several elderly milkmen, who have obviously been there for a very long time.<BR>

The Board of Trade has ratified a Trade Agreement with the Soviet Union for the sale of 600 low gear electric sewing machines. The President of the Board of Trade said he hoped this would
mark a new area of expansion in world trade and a new spirit of co-operation between East and West. There has been a substantial drop in Gold Reserves during the last twelve months.
