<FONT ID=Eric><I>(newsreel voice)</I> In the modern Britain, united under a great leader, it's the housewives of Britain who are getting things moving. <I>(Red Devils flying; picture of Edward Heath)</I> Here a coachload of lovely ladies are on their way to speed up production in a car factory. <I>(coach load of pepperpots, middle class, grey hair, Mary Whitehouse glasses; the coach says 'Tory Tours')</I> And here we are boys, it's the no-hurry brigade hanging about for endless overtime. And just watch these gallant girls go into action . .. <I>(cut to a factory yard; some workers in brown overalls are eating sandwiches out of tins; the clock says 1:15; the coach comes swinging in in undercrank, the ladies pour out about to belt the men with umbrellas and handbags; the men flee back into factories)</I> Not working fast enough? Well, there's an answer for that. <I>(a man at a machine, producing something incredibly fast; a pepperpot holds an enormous sledgehammer)</I> Yes, this is certainly the way to speed up production. <I>(wide shot of factory interior; three pepperpots stand on a gantry above work floor, wearing armbands, saying 'P.P.' and dark Mary Whitehouse glasses)</I> This is the recipe for increased productivity to meet the threat of those nasty foreigners when Britain takes her natural place at the head of the British Common Market. <I>(a group of strikers, picketing with slogans, 'Fair Pay', 'Less Profits', 'Parity', 'No Victimization')</I> And how's this for a way to beat strikers. <I>(pepperpots arrive, clinging to side of old Buick; they race in and start beating the strikers with the banners)</I> Those spotty continental boys will soon have to look out for Mrs Britain, and talking of windmills, these girls aren't afraid to tilt at the permissive society, <I>(art gallery exterior; pepperpots run in with bundles and ladders)</I> Business is booming in the so-called arts, but two can play at that game, chum. <I>(cut to art gallery interior, pan around paintings 'cleaned up'- trousers and cardigans being added to nude pictures and statues, Bermuda shorts on David, shorts on tubular structure, an attendant in shorts too)</I>. And it's not just the modern so-called plastic arts that get the clean-up treatment.</FONT>

He spent the morning dealing with the Irish situation and later in the day had long discussions with the Minister for running upstairs two at a time, flinging the door open and saying 'Ha, ha! Caught you, Mildred'. <I>(photo of the Houses of Parliament)</I> In the Commons there was another day of heated debate on the third reading of the Trade Practices Bill. Mr Roland Penrose, the Under-Secretary for making deep growling noises grrr, launched a bitter personal attack on the ex-Minister for delving deep into a black satin bag and producing a tube of Euthymol toothpaste. Later in the debate the Junior Minister for being frightened by any kind of farm machinery, challenged the Under-Secretary of State for hiding from Terence Rattigan to produce the current year's trading figures, as supplied by the Department of stealing packets of bandages from the self-service counter at Timothy Whites and selling them again at a considerable profit.

Well first of all I'd like to apologize for the behaviour of certain of my colleagues you may have seen earlier, but they are from broken homes, circus families and so on and they are in no way representative of the new modern improved British Navy. They are a small vociferous minority; and may I take this opportunity of emphasizing that there is no cannibalism in the British Navy. Absolutely none, and when I say none, I mean there is a certain amount, more than we are prepared to admit, but all new ratings are warned that if they wake up in the morning and find any toothmarks at all anywhere on their bodies, they're to tell me immediately so that I can immediately take every measure to hush the whole thing up. And, finally, necrophilia is right out. <I>(the interviewer keeps nodding but looks embarrassed)</I> Now, this expedition is primarily to investigate reports of cannibalism and necrophilia in... this expedition is primarily to investigate reports of unusual marine life in the as yet uncharted Lake Pahoe.</FONT>
