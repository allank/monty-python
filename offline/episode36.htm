<TR valign="top"><TD>

</TD><TD>
<FONT ID=TerryJ>Part-time, I'll have a look, sir. <I>(he gets out a book and looks through it)</I> Let me look now. We've got, ah yes, Sir Walter Raleigh is equipping another expedition to Virginia; he needs traders and sailors. Vittlers needed at the Court of Philip of Spain, oh, yes, and they want master joiners and craftsmen for the building of the Globe Theatre.</FONT>
</TD></TR>
<TR valign="top"><TD>

<FONT ID=Graham>I see. Have you anything a bit more modern, you know, like a job on the buses, or digging the underground?</FONT>

<FONT ID=TerryJ>Oh no, we only have Tudor jobs.</FONT>

<FONT ID=Graham>That can't be very profitable, can it?</FONT>
</TD></TR>
<TR valign="top"><TD>
Assistant
</TD><TD>
<FONT ID=TerryJ>Well, you'd be surprised, actually sir. The Tudor economy's booming, ever since Sir Humphrey Gilbert opened up the Northwest passage to Cathay, and the Cabots' expansion in Canada, there's been a tremendous surge in exports, and trade with the Holy Roman Empire is going... no, quite right, it's no good at all.</FONT>

<FONT ID=TerryJ>No, no, we were the tops then. Drake got all his sailors here. Elizabeth, we supplied the archbishops for her coronation. Shakespeare started off from here as a temp.

<I>The wall of the Tudor shop slides back to reveal the interior of a Soho dirty bookshop in the back room - a bare room with a counter and magazines in racks on the walls at eye-level. Three drably dressed men are thumbing through books. One of them is a vicar, one of them is gathering a huge pile. Behind the counter is a Soho toughie in Tudor gear showing books to Mr Nid - a tweedy, rather academic, respectable-looking man of senior years. The customer goes through, and the wall slides back.</I>

<I>Mix through to a Tudor dining room. At the table a group of Tudor gentry are sitting listening to Gaskell. Evidence of a banquet, and two minstrels in attendance. Gaskell has obviously just finished a story. Applause and laughter.</I>

Gaskell

<FONT ID=Michael>. .. then did we bust the Harry Tony mob, who did seek to import Scandinavian filth via Germany.

<I>Applause. They are all very impressed. Cut to exterior. A messenger on a horse rides full pelt straight towards the camera. It is dusk.

<FONT ID=Michael>And how many glasses is that?</FONT>

<FONT ID=Michael>That's excellent, Husband, excellent.</FONT>

Husband

<FONT ID=Eric>Yes... it means you can still keep your main sherry supply on the roof, but you can have an emergency supply underneath the vestry of 5,000 gallons.</FONT>

<TR valign="top"><TD>
Vicar
</TD><TD>
<FONT ID=Michael>Yes... and I could have dry sherry on the roof and Amontillado in the underground tank!</FONT>

<I>A group of Spanish singers in full national costumes with guitars bursts into the Vestry, noisily singing a song praising Amontillado. A man in an extravagant Spanish costume rushes in. His hat has a sign on it saying: 'Sherry, the drink of champions'. Two girls come in bearing maracas and Carmen Miranda style hats. Mr Kirkham looks fed up. The Spaniards finish their song, noisily.</I>
