<FONT ID=Eric>Who, a year ago, had heard of Mr and Mrs Brian Norris of 37, Gledhill Gardens, Parsons Green? And yet their epic journey in EBW 343 has set them alongside Thor Heyerdahl and Sir Edmund Hillary. Starting only with a theory, Mr Norris set out to prove that the inhabitants of Hounslow could have been descendants of the people of Surbiton who had made the great trek north. No newcomer to this field, Mr Norris's 'A Short History of Motor Traffic Between Purley and Esher' had become a best-selling minor classic in the car-swapping belt. <I>(shot of Mr Norris gazing into a window, where his book lies; there is a sign saying 'Remaindered')</I> But why would the people of Surbiton go to Hounslow? Mr Norris had noticed three things: <I>(split-screen shot of two identical semi-detached houses)</I> Firstly, the similarity of the houses. Secondly, the similarity of the costume between Hounslow and Surbiton, <I>(similarly, dressed suburbanites on other side of the split screen)</I> and thirdly, the similarity of speech.</FONT>

<FONT ID=Eric>Were these just coincidences, or were they, as Mr Norris believed, part of an identical cultural background? One further discovery convinced him. <I>(cut to two lawnmowers arranged on a table, as if they were exhibits in a museum, with type-written documentation in front of them for the visitor)</I> The lawnmower. Surely such a sophisticated household gadget could not have been generated independently in two separate areas. Mr Norris was convinced.</FONT>

<FONT ID=Eric>There was only one way to see if the journey between Surbiton and Hounslow was possible, and that was to try and make it.

<FONT ID=Eric>On the morning of the 24th, early to avoid the traffic, Mr Norris's historic expedition set out from Surbiton - destination Hounslow. Early on they began to perceive encouraging signs. <I>(cut to sign saying 'Hounslow 25 miles'; Mr Norris closely examines the sign, as would an archaeologist)</I> The writing on the sign was almost exactly the same as the writing in the AA book. They were on the right route. During the long hours of the voyage, Mr Norris's wife Betty kept a complete photographic record and made sandwiches. This is some of the unique footage which Mrs Norris got back from the chemists... <I>(badly shot pictures of sandwiches, with fingers in the lens, etc.)</I> Mile succeeded mile and the terrific strain was beginning to tell when suddenly, <I>(chord; Mr Norris points excitedly, pull back to reveal him standing on a bridge over the Kingston by-pass examining it through field glasses)</I> by an amazing stroke of luck, Mr Norris had come across the Kingston by-pass. This was something to tell the Round Table. <I>(cut to a map, it traces the two routes in red as the voice talks)</I> At this stage, Mr Norris was faced with two major divergent theories concerning his Surbiton ancestors. Did they take the Kingston by-pass, turning left at Barnes, or did they strike west up the A308 via Norbiton to Hampton Wick? Both these theories ran up against one big obstacle - the Thames, <I>(the car at a river bank; Mr and Mrs Norris puzzling; behind them three or four bridges with traffic pouring over)</I> lying like a silver turd between Richmond and Isleworth. This was a major setback. How could they possibly cross the river? Several hours of thought produced nothing. There was only one flask of coffee left when suddenly Mr Norris spotted something. <I>(cut to a sign saying Metropolitan Railway)</I> Could this have been the method used? Hardly daring to believe, Mr Norris led his expedition on to the 3.47. <I>(cut to them getting on the train)</I> Forty minutes later, via Clapham, Fulham, Chiswick and Brentford, they approached their goal: Hounslow. <I>(a sign saying 'Hounslow Central'; Mr Norris sticks a British flag on the platform; he poses for his wife's photos; much hand shaking)</I> Was this, then, the final proof? Something aroused the accountant's instinct buried deep in Mr Norris's make-up. <I>(cut to Mr Norris's eyes and furrowed brow)</I> The journey was possible, and yet .... <I>(zoom in on railway timetable on wall saying 'Trains to Surbiton every half hour')</I> 'Wrong Way' Norris had accidentally stumbled on a piece of anthropological history. It was the inhabitants of Hounslow who had made the great trek south to the sunnier pastures of Surbiton, and not vice versa, as he had originally surmised. This was the secret of Surbiton! Happy and contented Mr Norris returned to the calmer waters of chartered accountancy, for, in his way, 'Wrong Way' Norris was right.</FONT>

<FONT ID=Eric>Tschaikowsky. Was he the tortured soul who poured out his immortal longings into dignified passages of stately music, or was he just an old poof who wrote tunes? <I>(pull back to show a second presenter in the other chair)</I> Tonight on 'Farming Club' we're going to take an intimate look at Tschaikowsky <I>(a picture of Tschaikowsky on the screen)</I> and an intimate look at his friends. <I>(a picture of a naked sailor on a tiger-skin rug)</I> Incidentally, BBC Publications have prepared a special pamphlet to go with this programme called 'Hello Pianist', <I>(It comes up on the screen; on its cover there is a picture of a pig)</I> and it contains material that some people might find offensive but which is really smashing.</FONT>

<FONT ID=John>Peter Ilyich Tschaikowsky was born in 1840 in a Ken Russell film just outside St Petersburg. His father <I>(Leo McKern)</I>, a free-lance bishop, was married to Verna Plachenka <I>(Julie Christie)</I> but secretly deeply in love with Margo Farenka <I>(Shirley Abicair)</I> and the strangely flatulent Madame Ranevsky <I>(Norris McWhirter)</I>. Soon, however, the family <I>(Eldridge Cleaver, Moira Lister and Stan the Bat)</I> moved to the neighbouring industrial village of Omsk <I>(Eddie Waring)</I> where they soon found themselves, sadly, quite unable to cope <I>(Anthony Barber)</I>. In 1863, however, Tschaikowsky was sent to Moscow to study the piano and, when he'd finished that, the living room. Maurice takes up the story.</FONT>
