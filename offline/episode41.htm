Establishing shot of large Harrods-type store. Outside limousines and taxis are disgorging very rich customers. Small doormen in enormously large coats opening door of cars. A man with his nose bandaged comes out of the store. One large car pulls softly up to the curb, and as small doorman (Michael) opens its door, an enormously opulent lady (Terry J) in furs gets out. The doorman holds the door open. She knees him in the groin and walks on into the store. Chris Quinn (Eric) arrives on a bicycle. He parks the bicycle against the curb (the doorman flings it into the road) and goes into the outer hall of the store. He passes a couple leaving who also have noses bandaged. A gaggle of customers, mostly pepperpots, rush out. A very eager pepperpot lady shopper, going the other way, rushes between the two and bangs into a set of glass doors which have closed behind the gaggle. She cries out with pain clutching her nose and is escorted away by a large, coated attendant. Chris Quinn looks up at the list on the wall. It reads:</I>

<I>Quinn, knowing that there are doors, goes forward more cautiously and enters. The banging of noses on glass doors is a constant background theme. Cut to the gift department. A large lady is standing by counter holding a large cylinder with a rose attachment.</I>

<I>Chris walks by, watching with interest but not much concern, passing a customer whose back is on fire but who has not noticed. He approaches a counter with a sign saying 'Ant Counter'. He stands by the apparently empty counter for one moment, then rings a bell.</I>

<I>A strange rubber-masked head appears from below the other side of the counter and gesticulates at him making a strange noise. This soon stops.</I>

<FONT ID=Graham>No, no, I'll be very good, sir, really. <I>(he becomes exaggeratedly polite)</I> Good morning, sir... how are you, sir... bit parky outside today... isn't it, sir... ? A very nice suit you've got there, sir... you had a very close shave this morning, sir...</FONT>

<TR valign="top"><TD>
</TD><TD>
<I>After a pause, very slowly indeed an identical mask to the first appears over the top of the counter right next to the first assistant, making the same noise very quietly. The first assistant sees him, starts and nudges him hard.</I>

<TR valign="top"><TD>
Second Assistant

<FONT ID=Michael>Woooooo ....ooooooo...</FONT>
</TD></TR>
<TR valign="top"><TD>

<FONT ID=Graham>It's not him!</FONT>

<FONT ID=Eric>You know perfectly well what I mean.</FONT>
</TD></TR>
<TR valign="top"><TD>

<FONT ID=Michael>I'm afraid I don't, sir.</FONT>
</TD></TR>

Chris

<FONT ID=Eric>You were down behind there with a silly mask on going wooo-ooo...</FONT>

<TR valign="top"><TD>
Second Assistant
</TD><TD>
<FONT ID=Michael>I don't think I was, sir.</FONT>

<FONT ID=Eric>All right, get the manager.</FONT>
</TD></TR>
<TR valign="top"><TD>
Second Assistant
</TD><TD>
<FONT ID=Michael>There seems to have been some sort of misunderstanding, sir.</FONT>

Second Assistant

<FONT ID=Michael>It's a smashing store this, I can't recommend it too highly, well-lit, rat-free. It's a joy to manage.

<FONT ID=TerryJ>I see, sir. <I>(he goes round counter, looks, but obviously can't see them; Chris goes round to join in the search)</I>... well... there's nobody down here, sir.</FONT>
</TD></TR>
<TR valign="top"><TD>
Chris
</TD><TD>
<FONT ID=Eric>They must have crawled through here, and made their escape through 'Soft Toys'. <I>(he points)</I></FONT>
</TD></TR>
<TR valign="top"><TD>
Real Manager
</TD><TD>
<FONT ID=TerryJ>Yes, of course.</FONT>
</TD></TR>
<TR valign="top"><TD>
Chris
</TD><TD>
<FONT ID=Eric>They were wearing masks and making silly noises and one of them pretended to be the manager. He spoke like this.. <I>(he does an impression)</I></FONT>

<FONT ID=Eric>The <EM>store's</EM> rag week?</FONT>

<TR valign="top"><TD>
Hartford
</TD><TD>
<FONT ID=Michael>Well sir, they start about half a p. but they can go as high as three p. or even three and a half p. for a champion - inflation I'm afraid...</FONT>
</TD></TR>

<FONT ID=Michael>Ah yes, well you should get a very serviceable little animal for that, sir. Quite frankly the half pence ones are a bit on the mangy side ... What length was sir thinking of?</FONT>

<FONT ID=Eric>Oh ... medium?</FONT>

<FONT ID=Michael>Medium. Medium. Here we are, sir. <I>(he tips some ants - which we can't see - out into a special ring on counter)</I> That one there is an Ayrshire, and that one there is a King George bitch I think ... and that one killing the little flitbat is an Afghan.</FONT>

<FONT ID=Michael>Well, none at all really.

<FONT ID=Michael>I should, sir... much less painful. Anyway sir, you know what they say about an ant. A friend for life, eh? Well, a friend for its life anyway... <I>(Hartford loads the large cage, furniture, two-way radio and the book on ants into a huge box; with some difficulty he finds the ant; he picks it up carefully)</I> His name is Marcus. <I>(he drops him in the big box and pushes it across the counter; the box has on one side, in large letters 'live ant: handle with care'; it has breathing holes in it)</I> If the little chap should go to an early grave, sir, give us a ring and we'll stick a few in an envelope, all right?</FONT>

<I>Chris narrows his eyes suspiciously and gets into the lift cautiously. Cut to the kitchen in Chris Quinn's home. His mother is putting chopped meat into a line af at least half a dozen feeding bowls with various animal names on them. 'Babboon', 'Dromedary', 'Gorilla', 'Trout', and 'Pangolin'. There is a tiger in a cage in the middle of the kitchen, with a bowl marked 'Tiger' in front of him. A large cobra is hanging from the clothes drier and a wolf is in a cage below the sink. A monkey is on top of one of the cupboards. Chris enters with the box.</I>
