<FONT ID=Eric>Here is a preview of some of the programmes you'll be able to see coming shortly on BBC Television. To kick off with there's variety ... <I>(still picture of Peter West and Brian Johnston)</I> Peter West and Brian Johnston star in 'Rain Stopped Play', a whacky new comedy series about the gay exploits of two television cricket commentators <I>(photo of E. W. Swanton)</I> with E. W. Swanton as Aggie the kooky Scots maid. For those of you who don't like variety, there's variety, with Brian Close at the Talk of the Town. <I>(Brian Close in cricket whites on a stage)</I> And of course there'll be sport. The Classics series <I>(engraving of London and caption: 'The Classics')</I> return to BBC 2 with twenty-six episodes of John Galsworthy's 'Snooker My Way' <I>(composite photo of Nyree Dawn Porter holding a snooker cue)</I> with Nyree Dawn Porter repeating her triumph as Joe Davis. And of course there'll be sport. Comedy is not forgotten <I>(Caption: 'Comedy')</I> with Jim Laker <I>(photo of Laker)</I> in 'Thirteen Weeks of Off-spin Bowling'. Jim plays the zany bachelor bowler in a new series of 'Owzat', with Anneley Brummond-Haye on Mr Softee <I>(photo of same)</I> as his wife. And of course there'll be sport. 'Panorama' will be returning, introduced <I>('Panorama' caption with photo of Tony Jacklin)</I> as usual by Tony Jacklin, and Lulu <I>(photo of Lulu)</I> will be tackling the Old Man of Hoy <I>(photo of same)</I>. And for those of you who prefer drama - there's sport. On 'Show of the Week' Kenneth Wostenholme sings. <I>(still of him, superimposed over Flick Colby Dancers, Pans People, Ono)</I> And for those of you who don't like television there's David Coleman. <I>(picture of him smiling)</I> And of course there'll be sport. But now for something completely different - sport.</FONT>
