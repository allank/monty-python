<FONT ID=John>Well I now have the results here of the interviews and the aptitude tests that you took last week, and from them we've built up a pretty clear picture of the sort of person that you are.

<TR valign="top"><TD>

<FONT ID=Michael>Exciting? No it's <EM>not</EM>. It's dull. Dull. <EM>Dull</EM>. My God it's dull, it's so desperately dull and tedious and stuffy and boring and des-per-ate-ly DULL. </FONT>
</TD></TR>
<TR valign="top"><TD>
Counsellor
</TD><TD>
<FONT ID=John>Well, er, yes Mr Anchovy, but you see your report here says that you are an extremely dull person. You see, our experts describe you as an appallingly dull fellow, unimaginative, timid, lacking in initiative, spineless, easily dominated, no sense of humour, tedious company and irrepressibly drab and awful. And whereas in most professions these would be considerable drawbacks, in chartered accountancy they are a positive boon. </FONT>

</TD></TR>
<TR valign="top"><TD>

</TD><TD>
<FONT ID=John>Well yes. Yes. Of course, it's a bit of a jump isn't it? I mean, er, chartered accountancy to lion taming in one go. You don't think it might be better if you worked your way <EM>towards</EM> lion taming, say, via banking? </FONT>

<FONT ID=John>A hat? </FONT>
</TD></TR>
<TR valign="top"><TD>
Anchovy
</TD><TD>
<FONT ID=Michael>Yes, a hat. A lion taming hat. A hat with 'lion tamer' on it. I got it at Harrods. And it lights up saying 'lion tamer' in great big neon letters, so that you can tame them after dark when they're less stroppy. </FONT>

</TD></TR>
<TR valign="top"><TD>
Counsellor
</TD><TD>
<FONT ID=John>Yes, yes, yes, I do follow, Mr Anchovy, but you see the snag is... if I now call Mr Chipperfield and say to him, 'look here, I've got a forty-five-year-old chartered accountant with me who wants to become a lion tamer', his first question is not going to be 'does he have his own hat?' He's going to ask what sort of experience you've had with lions. </FONT>

<FONT ID=Michael>A what? </FONT>

You see a lion is a huge savage beast, about five feet high, ten feet long, weighing about four hundred pounds, running forty miles per hour, with masses of sharp pointed teeth and nasty long razor-sharp claws that can rip your belly open before you can say 'Eric Robinson', and they look like this. </FONT>

<A name="11">
<I>Cut to bedroom of a middle-aged, middle-class wealthy couple. It is dark. They are both lying fast asleep on their backs. The husband is a colonel type with a moustache. The wife has her hair in curlers and face cream on. Someone climbs in through the window and pads across to the wife. He is a dapper little Frenchman in a beret and carrying a fench loaf. He kisses her on the forehead. She wakes.</I>

<I>By this stage all the men have pulled up chairs in a circle around Vera's side of the bed. They are all chatting amongst themselves. Biggles is holding her hand. Maurice has produced a bottle of vin ordinaire. At this moment four Mexican musicans appear on the husband's side of the bed. The leader of the band nudges the husband, who wakes.</I>

<I>He immediately goes back to sleep again. The Mexicans all troop round the bed and enter the group. The leader conducts them and they start up a little conga . . . once they've started he turns and comes over to Vera with a naughty glint in his eye. They play a guitar, a trumpet and maracas.</I>

<I>Enter a huge man dressed as an Aztec god. He stretches arms open wide and is about to speak when owing to lack of money he is cut short by Vera.</I>
