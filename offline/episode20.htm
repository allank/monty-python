<FONT ID=TerryJ>Good evening. Tonight I'd like to restate our position on agricultural subsidies, <I>(soft breathy jazzy music creeps in behind his words and he starts to strip as he talks)</I> and their effect on our Commonwealth relationships. Now although we believe, theoretically, in ending guaranteed farm prices, we also believe in the need for a corresponding import levy to maintain consumer prices at a realistic level. But this would have the effect of consolidating our gains of the previous fiscal year, prior to the entry. But I pledge that should we join the Common Market - even maintaining the present position on subsidies - we will never jeopardize, we will never compromise our unique relationship with the Commonwealth countries. A prices structure related to any import charges will be systematically adjusted to the particular requirements of our Commonwealth partners <I>(he has now removed all his clothes apart from a tassel on each nipple and one on the front of some skin-tight briefs; he starts to revolve the tassels on his nipples)</I> - so that together we will maintain a positive, and mutually beneficial alliance in world trade <I>(he turns revealing a tassle on each buttock which he also revolves)</I> and for world peace.

<FONT ID=Michael>Good evening. Here is the news for Parrots. No parrots were involved in an accident on the M1 today when a lorry carrying high-octane fuel was in collison with a bollard. That's a <EM>bollard</EM> and not a <EM>parrot</EM>. A spokesman for parrots said he was glad no parrots were involved. The Minister of Technology <I>(photo of minister with parrot on his shoulder)</I> today met the three Russian leaders <I>(cut to photograph of Brezhnev, Podgorny and Kosygin all in a group and each with a parrot on his shoulder)</I> to discuss a &#163;4 million airliner deal...<I>(cut back to narrator)</I> None of them went in the cage, or swung on the little wooden trapeze or ate any of the nice millet seed yum, yum. That's the end of the news, now our program for parrots continues with part three of 'A Tale of Two Cities', specially adapted for parrots by Joey Boy. The story so far, Dr. Manette is in England after eighteen years <I>(as he speaks French Revolution type music creeps in under his words)</I> in the Bastille. His daughter Lucy awaits her lover Charles Darney, who we have just learned is in fact the nephew of the Marquis de St Evremond, whose cruelty had placed Manette in the Bastille.

<FONT ID=Eric>In the debate, a spokesman accused the goverment of being silly and doing not at all good things. The member accepted this in the spirit of healthy criticism, but denied that he had ever been naughty with a choir boy. Angry shouts of 'What about the Watermelon then?' were ordered then by the speaker to be stricken from the record and put into a brown paper bag in the lavvy. Any further interruptions would be cut up and distributed amongst the poor. For the Government, a front-bench spokesman said the Agricultural Tariff <EM>would</EM> have to be raised, and he fancied a bit. Futhermore, he argued, this would give a large boost to farmers, him, his friends, and Miss Moist of Knightsbridge. From the back benches there were opposition shouts of 'Postcards for sale' and a healthy cry of 'Who likes a sailor then?' from the minister without portfolio. Replying, the Shadow Minister said he could no longer deny the rumors, but he and the Dachshund were very happy. And in any case he argued Rhubarb was cheap, and what was the harm in a sauna bath?</FONT>
