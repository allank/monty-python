not think it fit. This is a particularly auspicious occasion for us
this evening, as we have been told that Her Majesty the Queen will be
watching part of the show tonight. We don't know exactly when Her
Majesty will be tuning in. We understand that at the moment she is
watching 'The Virginian', but we have been promised that we will be
informed the moment that she changes channel. Her majesty would like
everyone to behave quite normally but her equerry has asked me to
request all of you at home to stand when the great moment arrives,
although we here in the studio will be carrying on with our humorous
vignettes and spoofs in the ordinary way. Thank you. And now without
