<I> A man appears on the top of a sand dune some way away. He loks in direction of camera and runs towards it. He disappears on top of a closer dune and continues towards camera disappearing again into a dip. This time while he is out of sight, the sound of him running is the sound of someone running along a prison corridor, followed by a big door opening and closing.He appears again only two sand dunes away. Still running towards camera he disappears again from sight. This time there is a loud metallic series of sounds followed by a pig squealing. He appears over the nearest dune and runs up to camera.</I>

</FONT></TD></TR>
<TR valign="top"><TD>
Rustic
</TD><TD>
<FONT ID=Graham>A fair question and one that in recent weeks has been much on
my mind. It's my considered opinion that they're nesting.

<FONT ID=TerryJ>Like birds?
</FONT></TD></TR>
<TR valign="top"><TD>
Rustic
</TD><TD>
<FONT ID=Graham>Ar. Exactly. Birds is the key to the whole problem. It's my belief that these sheep are laborin' under the misapprehension that they're birds. Observe their behavior. Take for a start the sheeps' tendency to 'op about the field
on their back legs. <I>(off-screen baa-ing)</I> Now witness their attempts to fly from tree to tree. Notice that they do not so much fly as...plummet. <I>(sound of sheep plummeting)</I> Observe for example that ewe in that oak tree. She is clearly trying to teach her lamb to fly. <I>(baaaaaa...thump)</I> Talk about the blind leading the blind.
</FONT></TD></TR>
<TR valign="top"><TD>
City Gent
</TD><TD>
<FONT ID=TerryJ>But why do they think they're birds?
</FONT></TD></TR>
<TR valign="top"><TD>
Rustic
</TD><TD>
<FONT ID=Graham>Another fair question. One thing is for sure; a sheep is not a creature of the air. They have enormous difficulty in the comparatively simple act of perchin'. <I>(crash)</I> As you see. As for flight, its body is totally unadapted to the problems of aviation. Trouble is, sheep are very dim. Once they get an idea in their heads, there's no shifting it.
</FONT></TD></TR>
<TR valign="top"><TD>
City Gent
</TD><TD>
<FONT ID=TerryJ>But where did they get the idea from?
</FONT></TD></TR>
<TR valign="top"><TD>
Rustic
</TD><TD>
<FONT ID=Graham>From Harold. He's that sheep there over under the elm. He's that most dangerous of animals, a clever sheep. He's the ring-leader. He has realized that a sheep's life consists of standing around for a few months and then being eaten. And that's a depressing prospect for an ambitious sheep. He's patently hit on the idea of escape.
</FONT></TD></TR>

<FONT ID=Michael>But perhaps this is because so little is generally known of these mice men. We have
     some film now taken of one of the notorious weekend mouse parties, where these disgusting
     little perverts meet. </FONT>

<FONT ID=John>Well first of all you get shown to your own private hole in the skirting board... then you
     put the mouse skin on... then you scurry into the main room, and perhaps take a run in the
     wheel. </FONT>

<FONT ID=John>Well, er, then you steal some cheese, Brie or Camembert, or Cheddar or
     Gouda, if you're on the harder stuff. You might go and see one of the blue cheese films...
     there's a big clock in the middle of the room, and about 12:50 you climb up it and then
     ...eventually, it strikes one... and you all run down. </FONT>
