<I>Another door opens and a couple of rather respectable-looking old ladies bring out two bazookas and assorted shells and put them by the gate. There are further contributions of arms from householders. A GPO van comes up the street, passes the scrap cart and comes to rest up by the camera. There is a pillar box with a cover on it on the pavement, plus a rostrum with PA and bunting. A lord mayor is ushered out of the van by a post office official. The mayor and several ladies sit on the rostrum. Clearing his throat, the GPO official gets up, tests the microphone and starts to speak in a slightly strange voice.</I>

<FONT ID=Michael>We are here today to witness the opening of a new <EM>box</EM> to replace the <EM>box</EM> which used to stand at the corner of Ulverston Road and Sandwood Crescent. Owing to the road-widening programme carried out by the Borough Council, the Ulverston Road <EM>box</EM> was removed, leaving the wall <EM>box</EM> in Esher Road as the only <EM>box</EM> for the Ulverston Road area. This new <EM>box</EM> will enable the people of the Ulverston Road area to post letters, post-cards and small packages without recourse to the Esher Road <EM>box</EM> or to the <EM>box</EM> outside the post office at Turner's Parade which many people used to use, but which has now been discontinued owing to the opening of this <EM>box</EM> and also the re-organization of <EM>box</EM> distribution throughout the whole area, which comes into force with the opening of new <EM>boxes</EM> at the Wyatt Road Post Office in July. <I>(a moment's pause)</I> Nous sommes ici ce matin pour loire t&eacute;moin &agrave; l'ouvermre de la nouvelle <EM>bo&icirc;te</EM> pour remplacer la <EM>bo&icirc;te</EM> qui autrefois &eacute;tait plac&eacute;e au coin d'Ulverston Road et Sandwood Crescent.

<I>A train stops at the station. The train doors open and out steps Mr Neutron. He looks like an American footballer, with enormous shoulders, tapering to a thin waist.

<I>A high-security operations room - maps, charts. monitor screens. A message comes chattering over the teleprinter. A teleprinter operator rips it out and takes it over to Captain Carpenter who sits at a control desk.</I>

<I>Cut to a large room, empty apart from a very large desk with a large American eagle emblem above it. We hear American military music. There is nothing on the desk, except for a very futuristic, dynamic-looking intercom. Behind the desk the supreme commander sits. After a moment, slowly and rather surreptitiously, he sniffs his left armpit inside his jacket. Then, with a quick look around to see that no one is watching, he smells the other armpit. He sits up again, then cups his hand in front of his face to smell his breath. He looks worried still. He reaches down slowly and takes his shoe off. He has just brought it up to his nose when the intercorn buzzes loudly and a light flashes. The music stops. He jumps, and quickly takes his shoe off the desk. He presses a switch on the intercom.</I>

<FONT ID=Michael>So the world was in the grip of FEAR!

<I>She walks off. Neutron goes back to his weeding. Cut back to the supreme commander's office.

<I>Cut to Carpenter in a log cabin trading post with trestle tables. Six Eskimos are sitting in a group at one end of the other tables. An Italian chef in a long white apron and greasy shirt, is standing over Carpenter. Carpenter sits at one table with a huge fresh salad in front of him.</I>

<I>Cut to a picture of the outside of l0 Downing Street. Zoom in on the door. Music: 'Rule Britannia' type theme. Cut to interior - a few circular tables, dim lighting. The decor of a rather exclusive restaurant. Subdued murmur of upper-class people stuffing their faces. A gypsy violinist is going from table to table playing and singing. In the middle of all this there is the prime minister at a big leather-topped desk, covered with official papers, three telephones, an intercom, tape recorder, a photo of Eisenhower with a very small bunch of flowers in front of it in a sort of self-contained shrine, an in/out tray, blotter, etc. The intercom buzzes.</I>

<I>The diners have by this time joined a conga led by the gypsy violinist playing 'My Mistake'. Awfully heartily they dance past the prime minister's desk. Cut to Artic wastes. The wind howls.
