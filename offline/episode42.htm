<A name="11">
Exterior, a large, tasteful, Georgian rich person's house with extensive gardens beautifully tended, croquet hoops on the lawn - all in superb taste, nothing vulgar. The sun shines tastefully. The atmosphere is calm. Birds sing. Sound of lawnmovers and cricket in the distance. Laughter from the tennis court. Sound of gardener sharpening spades in the potting shed. Out of vision, a Red Indian struggles to free himself from the rope bonds that bind him. We hear 'Where does a dream begin' being played on a cracked record.</I>

We interrupt show jumping to bring you a news flash. The Second World War has now entered a sentimental stage. The morning on the Ardennes Front, the Germans started spooning at dawn, but the British Fifth Army responded by gazing deep in their eyes, and the Germans are reported to have gone 'all coy'.

When does a dream begin?<br>
Does it start with a goodnight kiss?<br>
Is it conceived or simply achieved<br>
When does a dream begin?<br>
Is it born in a moment of bliss?<br>
Or is it begun when two hearts are one<br>
When does a dream exist?<br>
The vision of you appears somehow<br>
Impossible to resist<br>
But I'm not imagining seeing you<br>
For who could have dreamed of this?<br>
When does a dream begin?<br>
When reality is dismissed?<br>
Or does it commence when we lose all pretence<br>
When does a dream begin?
