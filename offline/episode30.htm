<FONT ID=John><I>(German accent)</I> In the hard and unrelenting world of nature the ceaseless struggle for survival continues. <I>(one of the pantomime horses turns tail and runs out)</I> This time one of the pantomime horses concedes defeat and so lives to fight another day. <I>(cut to stock film of sea lions fighting)</I> Here, in a colony of sea lions, we see a huge bull sea lion seeing off an intruding bull who is attempting to intrude on his harem. This pattern of aggressive behaviour is typical of these documentaries. <I>(cut to shot of two almost stationary limpets)</I> Here we see two limpets locked in a life or death struggle for territory. The huge bull limpet, enraged by the rock, endeavours to encircle its sprightly opponent. <I>(shot of wolf standing still)</I> Here we see an ant. This ant is engaged in a life or death struggle with the wolf. You can see the ant creeping up on the wolf on all sixes. <I>(a moving arrow is superimposed)</I> Now he stops to observe. Satisfied that the wolf has not heard him, he approaches nearer. With great skill he chooses his moment and then, quick as a limpet, with one mighty bound <I>(the arrow moves to the wolf's throat; the wolf does not move)</I> buries his fangs in the wolf's neck. The wolf struggles to no avail. A battle of this kind can take anything up to fifteen years because the timber ant has such a tiny mouth. <I>(distant shot of two men fighting violently)</I> Here we see Heinz Sielmann engaged in a life or death struggle with Peter Scott. They are engaged in a bitter punch-up over repeat fees on the overseas sales of their nature documentaries. <I>(another man joins in)</I> Now they have been joined by an enraged Jacques Cousteau. This is typical of the harsh and bitchy world of television features. <I>(shot of honey bear sitting about aimlessly)</I> Here we see a honey bear not engaged in a life or death struggle about anything. These honey bears are placid and peaceful creatures and consequently bad television. <I>(shot of pantomime horse running along in a wood)</I> Here we see a pantomime horse. It is engaged in a life or death struggle for a job with a merchant bank. However, his rival employee, the huge bull pantomime horse, is lying in wait for him. <I>(pantomime horse behind tree drops sixteen-ton weight on the horse running under the tree)</I> Poor pantomime horse. <I>(shot of pantomime goose behind a small tree with a bow and arrow)</I> Here we see a pantomime goose engaged in a life or death struggle with Terence Rattigan. <I>(we see Terrace walking along)</I> The enraged goose fires. <I>(the goose fires and hits Terence in the neck; Terrace looks amazed and dies)</I> Poor Terence. Another victim of this silly film. <I>(shot of an amazing-looking large woman with a crown waiting in the undergrowth by the side of a path)</I> Here we see an enraged pantomime Princess Margaret, she is lying in wait for her breakfast. <I>(a breakfast tray appears being pulled along the path by a length of wire)</I> The unsuspecting breakfast glides ever closer to its doom. The enraged pantomime royal person is poised for the kill. She raises her harpoon and fires. <I>(the pantomime Princess Margaret does so, hurling the harpoon at the moving tray)</I> Pang!

Behind him on the screen a collage of photos appear one after the other: Richard Nixon, Tony Armstrong-Jones, the White House, Princess Margaret, parliament, naked breasts, a scrubbing brush, a man with a stoat through his head, Margaret Thatcher, a lavatory, a Scotsman lying on his back with his knees drawn up, a corkscrew, Edward Heath, a pair of false teeth in a glass. Whilst these have been going on Baker has been making gestures starting with elbow-up gesture and getting progressively more obscure and intriguing. We don't hear him at all, we hear all the announcers having a party and congratulating Jack.</I>
