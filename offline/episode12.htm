Von Ribbentrop at the back with a large banner 'Hilter for a better Meinhead'. Himmler in the middle with an old grammophone playing 'Deutschland &Uuml;ber Alles'.<BR>

Zalling? Is there a word zalling? If there is what does it mean...if there isn't what does it mean? Perhaps both. Maybe neither. What do I mean by the word mean?

<FONT ID=John>Good afternoon and welcome to Hurlingham Park. You join us just as the competitors are running out onto the field on this lovely winter's afternoon here, with the going firm underfoot and very little sign of rain. Well it certainly looks as though we're in for a splendid afternoon's sport in this the 127th Upperclass Twit of the Year Show. Well the competitors will be off in a moment so let me just identify for you. <I>(close-up of the competitors)</I> Vivian Smith-Smythe-Smith has an O-level in chemo-hygiene. Simon-Zinc-Trumpet-Harris, married to a very attractive table lamp. Nigel Incubator-Jones, his best friend is a tree, and in his spare time he's a stockbroker. Gervaise Brook-Hampster is in the Guards, and his father uses him as a wastepaper basket. And finally Oliver St John-Mollusc, Harrow and the Guards, thought by many to be this year's outstanding twit. Now they're moving up to the starting line, there's a jolly good crowd here today. Now they're under starter's orders ... and they're off! <I>(the starter fires the gun; nobody moves)</I> Ah no, they're not. No they didn't realize they were supposed to start. Never mind, we'll soon sort that out, the judge is explaining it to them now. I think Nigel and Gervaise have got the idea. All set to go. <I>(starter fires gun again; the twits move off erratically)</I> Oh, and they're off and it's a fast start this year. Oliver St John-Mollusc running a bit wide there and now they're coming into their first test, the straight line. <I>(the twits make their way erratically along five white lines)</I> They've got to walk along this straight line without failing over and Oliver's over at the back there, er, Simon's coming through quite fast on the outside, I think Simon and Nigel, both of them coming through very fast. There's Nigel there. No. Three, I'm sorry, and on the outside there's Gervaise coming through just out of shot and now, the position... <I>(the twits approach a line of matchboxes piled three high)</I> Simon and Vivian at the front coming to the matchbox jump.. three layers of matchboxes to clear... and Simon's over and Vivian's over beautifully, oh and the jump of a lifetime - if only his father could understand. Here's Nigel ... and now Gervaise is over he's, er, Nigel is over, and it's Gervaise, Gervaise is going to jump it, is it, no he's jumped the wrong way, there he goes, Nigel's over, beautifully. Now it's only Oliver. Oliver ... and Gervaise... oh bad luck. And now it's Kicking the Beggar. <I>(the twits are kicking a beggar with a vending tray)</I> Simon's there and he's putting the boot in, and not terribly hard, but he's going down and Simon can move on. Now Vivian's there. Vivian is there and waiting for a chance. Here he comes, oh a piledriver, a real piledriver, and now Simon's on No. l, Vivian 2, Nigel 3, Gervaise on 4 and Oliver bringing up the rear. Ah there's Oliver <I>(Oliver is still trying to jump the matchboxes)</I>, there's Oliver now, he's at the back. I think he's having a little trouble with his old brain injury, he's going to have a go, no, no, bad luck, he's up, he doesn't know when he's beaten, this boy, he doesn't know when he's winning either. He doesn't have any sort of sensory apparatus. Oh there's Gervaise <I>(He is still kicking the beggar)</I> and he's putting the boot in there and he's got the beggar down and the steward's giving him a little bit of advice, yes, he can move on now, he can move on to the Hunt Photograph. He's off, Gervaise is there and Oliver's still at the back having trouble with the matchboxes. <I>(the twits approach a table with two attractive girls and a photographer)</I> Now here's the Hunt Ball Photograph and the first here's Simon, he's going to enjoy a joke with Lady Arabella Plunkett. She hopes to go into films, and Vivian's through there and, er, Nigel's there enjoying a joke with Lady Sarah Pencil Farthing Vivian Streamroller Adams Pie Biscuit Aftershave Gore Stringbottom Smith. <I>(shot of twit in a sports car reversing into cut-out of old woman)</I> And there's, there's Simon now in the sports car, he's reversed into the old woman, he's caught her absolutely beautifully. Now he's going to accelerate forward there to wake up the neighbour. There's Vivian I think, no Vivian's lost his keys, no there's Vivian, he's got the old woman, slowly but surely right in the midriff, and here he is. Here he is to wake up the neighbour now. <I>(a man in bed in the middle of the pitch; twit slams car door repeatedly)</I> Simon right in the lead, comfortably in the lead, but he can't get this neighbour woken up. He's slamming away there as best he can. He's getting absolutely no reaction at all. There, he's woken him up and Simon's through. Here comes Vivian, Vivian to slam the door, and there we are back at the Hunt Ball, I think that's Gervaise there, that's Gervaise going through there, and here, here comes Oliver, brave Oliver. Is he going to make it to the table, no I don't think he is, yes he is, <I>(Oliver falls over the table)</I> he did it, ohh. And the crowd are rising to him there,and there I can see, who is that there, yes that's Nigel, Nigel has woken the neighbour - my God this is exciting. Nigel's got very excited and he's going through and here comes Gervaise. Gervaise, oh no this is, er, out in the front there is Simon who is supposed to insult the waiter and he's forgotten. <I>(Simon runs past a waiter standing with a tray)</I> And Oliver has run himself over, <I>(Oliver lying in front of car)</I> what a great twit! And now here comes Vivian, Vivian to insult the waiter, and he is heaping abuse on him, and he is humiliating him, there and he's gone into the lead. Simon's not with him, no Vivian's in front of him at the bar. <I>(the twits each have several goes at getting under a bar of wood five feet off the ground)</I> Simon's got to get under this bar and this is extremely difficult as it requires absolutely expert co-ordination between mind and body. No Vivian isn't there. Here we go again and Simon's fallen backwards. Here's Nigel, he's tripped, Nigel has tripped, and he's under and Simon fails again, er, here is Gervaise, and Simon is through by accident. Here's Gervaise to be the last one over, there we are, here's Nigel right at the head of the field, <I>(the twits approach five rabbits staked out on the ground; they fire at them with shotguns)</I> and now he's going to shoot the rabbit, and these rabbits have been tied to the ground, and they're going to be a bit frisky, and this is only a one-day event. And they're blazing away there. They're not getting quite the results that they might, Gervaise is in there trying to bash it to death with the butt of his rifle, and I think Nigel's in there with his bare hands, but they're not getting the results that they might, but it is a little bit misty today and they must be shooting from a range of at least one foot. But they've had a couple of hits there I think, yes, they've had a couple of hits, and the whole field is up again and here they are. <I>(they approach a line of shopwindow dummies each wearing only a bra)</I> They're coming up to the debs, Gervaise first, Vivian second, Simon third. And now they've got to take the bras off from the front, this is really difficult, this is really the most, the most difficult part of the entire competition, and they're having a bit of trouble in there I think, they're really trying now and the crowd is getting excited, and I think some of the twits are getting rather excited too. <I>(the twits are wreaking havoc on the dummies)</I> Vivian is there, Vivian is coming through, Simon's in second place, and, no there's Oliver, he's not necessarily out of it. There goes Nigel, no he's lost something, and Gervaise running through to this final obstacle. <I>(they approach a table with five revolvers laid out on it)</I> Now all they have to do here to win the title is to shoot themselves. Simon has a shot. Bad luck, he misses. Nigel misses. Now there's Gervaise, and Gervaise has shot himself - Gervaise is Upperclass Twit of the Year. There's Nigel, he's shot Simon by mistake, Simon is back up and there's Nigel, Nigel's shot himself: Nigel is third in this fine and most exciting Upperclass Twit of the Year Show I've ever seen. Nigel's clubbed himself into fourth place. <I>(three coffins on stand with medals)</I> And so the final result: The Upperclass Twit of the Year - Gervaise Brook-Hampster of Kensington and Weybridge; runner up - Vivian Smith-Smythe-Smith of Kensington; and third - Nigel Incubator-Jones of Henley. Well there'll certainly be some car door slamming in the streets of Kensington tonight. </FONT>

<FONT ID=John>The story so far: Rosamund's father has become ensnared by Mr Shabby's extraordinary personal magnetism. Bob and Janet have eaten Mr Farquar's goldfish during an Oxfam lunch, and Mrs Elsmore's marriage is threatened by Doug's insistence that he is on a different level of consciousness. Louise's hernia has been confirmed, and Jim, Bob's brother, has run over the editor of the 'Lancet' on his way to see Jenny, a freelance Pagoda designer. On the other side of the continent Napoleon still broods over the smouldering remains of a city he had crossed half the earth to conquer... </FONT>

Minister
</TD><TD>
<FONT ID=Graham>Good evening. We in the Wood Party feel very strongly that the present weak drafting of the Local Government Bill leaves a lot to be desired, and we intend to fight. </FONT>
</TD></TR>
<TR valign="top"><TD>
</TD><TD>
<I>He thumps on the desk and he falls through the floor. (Yes Mr Director you did read that right: he fell through the floor and added a fortune to the budget). As he falls he emits a long scream, fading away slowly. Another man comes and looks down into the pit.</I>

Man
</TD><TD>
<FONT ID=Eric>Hello Helllllllllloooooooooo! <I>(to camera)</I> Er I, I'm afraid the minister's fallen through the Earth's crust. Er... excuse me a moment. <I>(goes and looks at pit)</I> Helloooo. </FONT>

<FONT ID=Graham>I appear to have landed on this kind of ledge thing. </FONT>

<FONT ID=Graham>If you'd be so kind. </FONT>

<FONT ID=Eric>What length of BBC rope will we be likely to need? </FONT>
</TD></TR>
<TR valign="top"><TD>
Minister
</TD><TD>
<FONT ID=Graham>I should use the longest BBC rope. That would be a good idea I would imagine. </FONT>
</TD></TR>
<TR valign="top"><TD>
Man
</TD><TD>
<FONT ID=Eric>Okey doke chief. Er, Tex get the longest BBC rope, and bring it here pronto. </FONT>
</TD></TR>
<TR valign="top"><TD>
Minister
</TD><TD>
<FONT ID=Graham><I>(still a long way down)</I> In the meantime, since I am on all channels, perhaps I'd better carry on with this broadcast by shouting about our housing plans from down here as best I can. Could someone throw me down a script. <I>(man drops the script down and Tex appears with enormous coil of rope)</I> The script would appear to have landed on a different ledge somewhat out of my grasp, don't you know. </FONT>
</TD></TR>
<TR valign="top"><TD>
Man
</TD><TD>
<FONT ID=Eric>Er, well perhaps when the rope reaches you minister you could kind of swing over to the ledge and grab it. </FONT>

<FONT ID=Graham>Good idea. </FONT>

<FONT ID=Graham>Good evening.

Ah. There we are. <I>(he swings over and grabs the script with one hand; he turns to camera and continues)</I> Good evening.

<FONT ID=Graham>Oh good. Look, er, I'm sorry about this, but there seem to be a few gremlins about... I think I'd better start from the beginning.

</TD></TR>

<I>Meanwhile a man, the right way up, has been lowered down to the minister. As the picture is reversed, he appears to be moving straight up towards him. The minister sees him.</I>

Minister
</TD><TD>
<FONT ID=Graham>Ah. Thank you. <I>(taking script; the man on the rope starts to climb back up)</I> Good evening, we in the Wood Party feel very strongly about the present weak drafting... <I>(man falls past with a scream)</I> Look. I think we'd better call it a day. </FONT>

<I>Cut to Robert.</I>
</TD></TR>
<TR valign="top"><TD>
Second Robert
</TD><TD>
<FONT ID=Eric>Well surprisingly not. The Canadian Minister for External Affairs fell nearly seven miles during a Liberal Conference in Ottawa about six years ago, and then quite recently the Kenyan Minister for Agric. and Fish fell nearly twelve miles during a Nairobi debate in Parliament, although this hasn't been ratified yet. </FONT>

<TR valign="top"><TD>
First Robert
</TD><TD>
<FONT ID=TerryJ>Er, how far did the Filipino cabinet fall last March? </FONT>
</TD></TR>
<TR valign="top"><TD>
Second Robert
</TD><TD>
<FONT ID=Eric>Er, well they fell nearly thirty-nine miles but it's not really so remarkable as that was due to their combined weight, of course. Robert. </FONT>
</TD></TR>
<TR valign="top"><TD>
First Robert
</TD><TD>
<FONT ID=TerryJ>Thank you, Robert. Well now what's your reaction to all this, Robert? </FONT>

 <I>Cut to third Robert who is staring intently into camera. He is wearing a fright wig and has a left eyebrow four inches above his right one.</I>
</TD></TR>
<TR valign="top"><TD>
Third Robert
</TD><TD>
<FONT ID=John>Well, well Robert the main thing is that it's terribly exciting. You see the minister is quite clearly lodged between rocks we know terribly little of. Terribly little. Of course the main thing is we're getting colour pictures of an extraordinarily high quality. The important thing is, the really exciting thing is the minister will <I>(as he gets more excited he starts to emit smoke)</I> be bringing back samples of the Earth's core which will give us a tremendous, really tremendous tremendous tremendous clue about the origins of the Earth and what God himself is made of. <I>(he bursts into fire and someone has to throw a buckets of water over him)</I> Oh, oh I needed that. </FONT>

<FONT ID=TerryJ>Thank you Robert. Well that seems to be about all we have time for tonight. Unless anyone has anything else to say. Has anyone anything else to say? </FONT>
</TD></TR>
<TR valign="top"><TD>
</TD><TD>
<I>Various 'noes' plus one 'bloody fairy' and more noes, from a very rapid montage of all the possible characters in this week's show saying 'no'. The last one we come to is the Spectrum presenter. He says more than no.</I>
