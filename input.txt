CAPTION: 'IT'S WOLFGANG AMADEUS MOZART'

Mozart sitting at piano tinkling with the keys. He finishes tinkling.

Mozart

Hello again, and welcome to the show. Tonight we continue to look at some famous deaths. Tonight we start with the wonderful death of Genghis Khan, conqueror of India. Take it away Genghis.

Cut to Genghis Khan's tent. Genghis strides about purposefully. Indian-style background music. Suddenly the music cuts out and Genghis Khan with a squawk throws himself in the air and lands on his back. This happens very suddenly. Judges hold up cards with points on, in the manner of ice skating judges.

Voice Over

9.1, 9.3, 9.7, that's 28.1 for Genghis Khan.

Mozart still at piano.

Mozart

Bad luck Genghis. Nice to have you on the show. And now here are the scores.

Scoreboard with Eddie Waring figure standing by it. The scoreboard looks a little like this:

St Stephan 29.9 Richard III 29.3 Jean D'arc 29.1 Marat 29.0 A. Lincoln (U.S of A)  28.2 G. Khan 28.1 King Edward VII 3.1 

Eddie

Well there you can see the scores now. St Stephen in the lead there with his stoning, then comes King Richard the Third at Bosworth Field, a grand death that, then the very lovely Jean d'Arc, then Marat in his bath - best of friends with Charlotte in the showers afterwards - then A. Lincoln of the U.S of A, a grand little chap that, and number six Genghis Khan, and the back marker King Edward the Seventh. Back to you, Wolfgang.

Mozart

Thank you, Eddie. And now time for this week's request death.

Mozart still there. He looks at watch.

Mozart

Oh blimey, how time flies. Sadly we are reaching the end of yet another programme and so it is finale time. We are proud to be bringing to you one of the evergreen bucket kickers. Yes, the wonderful death of the famous English Admiral Nelson.

Cut to a modern office block, as high as possible. After a pause a body flies out of the top window looking as much like Nelson as possible. As it plummets there is a strangled scream.

Nelson

Kiss me Hardy!

The body hits the ground. There is the loud noise of a pig squealing.

Cut to a night school Teacher looking down out of classroom window. He crosses to a long wall blackboard with line of pigs drawn on near end. He crosses one off, walks along blackboard to other end which has written on it 'evening classes 7-8 p.m.'. He writes 'Italian' below this and turns to camera.

Teacher

Ah - good evening everyone, and welcome to the second of our Italian language classes, in which we'll be helping you brush up your Italian. Last week we started at the beginning, and we learnt the Italian for a 'spoon'. Now, I wonder how many of you can remember what it was?

Shout of 'Si! Si! Si!' from the class whom we see are all Italians.

Teacher

Not all at once ... sit down Mario. Giuseppe!

Giuseppe

Il cucchiaio.

Teacher

Well done Giuseppe, or, as the Italians would say: 'Molto bene, Giuseppe'.

Giuseppe

Grazie signor ... grazie di tutta la sua gentilezza.

Teacher

Well, now, this week we're going to learn some useful phrases to help us open a conversation with an Italian. Now first of all try telling him where you come from. For example, I would say: 'Sono Inglese di Gerrard's Cross', I am an Englishman from Gerrard's Cross. Shall we all try that together?

All

Sono Inglese di Gerrard's Cross.

Teacher

Not too bad, now let's try it with somebody else. Er... Mr... ?

Mariolini

Mariolini.

Teacher

Ah, Mr Mariolini, and where are you from?

Mariolini

Napoli, signor.

Teacher

Ah ... you're an Italian.

Mariolini

Si, si signor!

Teacher

Well in that case you would say: 'Sono Italiano di Napoli'.

Mariolini

Ah, capisco, mile grazie signor...

Francesco

Per favore, signor!

Teacher

Yes?

Francesco

Non conosgeve parliamente, signor devo me parlo sono Italiano di Napoli quando il habitare de Milano.

Teacher

I'm sorry ... I don't understand!

Giuseppe

pointing to Francesco

Giuseppe

My friend say 'Why must he say...'

Hand goes up at back of room and a Lederhosen Teutonic figure stands up.

German

Bitte mein Herr. Was ist das Won für Mittelschmerz?

Teacher

Ah! Helmut - you want the German classes.

German

Oh ja! Danke schön.

German

he starts to leave

German

Giuseppe

My friend he say, 'Why must I say I am Italian from Napoli when he lives in Milan?'

Teacher

Ah, I... well, tell your friend ... if he lives in Milan he must say 'Sono Italiano di Milano...'

Francesco

agitatedly, leaping to his feet

Francesco

Eeeeeee! Milano è tanto meglio di Napoli. Milano è la citta la più bella di tutti ... nel mondo...

Giuseppe

He say 'Milan is better than Napoli'.

Teacher

Oh, he shouldn't be saying that, we haven't done comparatives yet.

In the background everyone has started talking in agitated Italian. At this point a genuine mandolin-playing Italian secreted amongst the cast strikes up: 'Quando Caliente Del Sol...' or similar. The class is out of control by this time. The teacher helplessly tries to control then but eventually gives up and retreats to his desk and sits down. There is a loud pig squeal and he leaps up.

ANIMATION:

The Blackboard with the coloured pigs drawn on it, is reproduced on the first few frames of the animation film. A real hand comes into the picture and crosses off a third pig. Thereafter action follows the dictates of Señor Gilliam's wonderfully visual mind.

Good evening. One of the most prolific film directors of this age, or indeed of any age, is Sir Edward Ross, back in his native country for the first time for five years to open a season of his works at the National Film Theatre, and we are very fortunate to have him with us in this studio this evening.

Ross

Good evening.

Second Interviewer

Edward... you don't mind if I call you Edward?

Ross

No, not at all.

Second Interviewer

Only it does worry some people - I don't know why...but they are a little sensitive so I take the precaution of asking on these occasions.

Ross

No, no, no that's fine.

Second Interviewer

So Edward's all right. Splendid. Splendid. I'm sorry to have brought it up, only eh...

Ross

No, no, please. Edward it is.

Second Interviewer

Well thank you very much for being so helpful...only it's more than my job's worth to...er...

Ross

Quite, yes.

Second Interviewer

Makes it rather difficult to establish a rapport ... to put the other person at his ease...

Ross

Quite.

Second Interviewer

Yes, silly little point but it does seem to matter. Still - less said the better. Uh...Ted...when you first started in...you don't mind if I call you Ted?

Ross

No, no, no everyone calls me Ted.

Second Interviewer

Well it's shorter, isn't it.

Ross

Yes it is.

Second Interviewer

Yes, and much less formal!

Ross

Yes, Ted, Edward, anything!

Second Interviewer

Splendid, splendid. Incidentally, do call me Tom, I don't want you playing around with any of this 'Thomas' nonsense! Ha ha ha ha! Now where were we? Ah yes. Eddie-baby, when you first started in the...

Ross

I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but I don't like being called 'Eddie-baby'.

Third Interviewer and Arthur 'Two Sheds' Jackson. Musical score blow-up behind.

Third Interviewer

Last week the Royal Festival Hall saw the first performance of a new symphony by one of the world's leading modern composers, Arthur 'Two Sheds' Jackson. Mr Jackson.

Jackson

Good evening.

Third Interviewer

May I just sidetrack for one moment. Mr. Jackson, this, what shall I call it, nickname of yours.

Jackson

Ah yes.

Third Interviewer

'Two sheds'. How did you come by it?

Jackson

Well, I don't use it myself, it's just a few of my friends call me 'Two Sheds'.

Third Interviewer

I see, and do you in fact have two sheds?

Jackson

No. No, I've only one shed. I've had one for some time, but a few years ago I said I was thinking of getting another one, and since then some people have called me 'Two Sheds'.

Third Interviewer

In spite of the fact that you only have one.

Jackson

Yes.

Third Interviewer

I see, and are you thinking of purchasing a second shed?

Jackson

No!

Third Interviewer

To bring you in line with your epithet?

Jackson

No.

Third Interviewer

I see, I see. Well let's return to your symphony. Ah, now then, did you write this symphony...

Third Interviewer

in

Third Interviewer

the shed?

Third Interviewer

Have you written any of your recent works in this shed of yours?

Jackson

No it's just a perfectly ordinary garden shed.

A picture of a shed appears on the screen behind them.

Third Interviewer

I see. And you're thinking of buying this second shed to write in.

Jackson

No, no. Look. This shed business, it doesn't really matter at all, the sheds aren't important. It's just a few friends call me Two Sheds and that's all there is to it. I wish you'd ask me about my music. I'm a composer. People always ask me about the sheds, they've got it out of proportion, I'm fed up with the shed, I wish I'd never got it in the first place.

Third Interviewer

I expect you are probably thinking of selling one.

Jackson

I will sell one.

Third Interviewer

Then you'll be Arthur 'No Sheds' Jackson?

Jackson

Look, forget about the sheds. They don't matter.

Third Interviewer

Mr. Jackson, I think, with respect, we ought to talk about your symphony.

Jackson

What?

Third Interviewer

Apparently your symphony was written for organ and tympani.

Jackson

catches sight of the picture of the shed behind hin

Jackson

What's that?

Third Interviewer

What's what?

Jackson

It's a shed. Get it off.

He points to BP screen shed. The picture of the shed disappears and is replaced by a picture of Jackson. Jackson looks at it carefully.

Jackson

Right.

Cut back to studio: the picture of him is replaced by a picture of two sheds, one with a question mark over it.

Third Interviewer

I understand that, about thirty years ago, you were extremely interested in train-spotting.

Jackson

What's that got to do with my bloody music?

Enter Second Interviewer from Edward Ross sketch (John)

Second Interviewer

Are you having any trouble from him?

Third Interviewer

Yes, a little.

And now for more news of the momentous artistic event in which Pablo Picasso is doing a specially commissioned painting for us whilst riding a bicycle. Pablo Picasso - the founder of modern art - without doubt the greatest abstract painter ever... for the first time painting in motion. But first of all let's have a look at the route he'll be taking.

Cut to Raymond Baxter type standing in front of map. A small cardboard cut-out of Picasso's face is on map and is moved around to illustrate route.

Baxter

Well Picasso will be starting, David, at Chichester here, he'll then cycle on the A29 to Fontwell, he'll then take the A272 which will bring him on to the A3 just north of Hindhead here. From then on Pablo has a straight run on the A3 until he meets the South Circular at Battersea here. Well, this is a truly remarkable occasion as it is the first time that a modern artist of such stature has taken the A272, and it'll be very interesting to see how he copes with the heavy traffic round Wisborough Green. Vicky.

Cut to Vicky, holding a bicycle.

Vicky

Well Picasso will be riding his Viking Super Roadster with the drop handlebars and the dual-thread wheel-rims and with his Wiley-Prat 20-1 synchro-mesh he should experience difficulties on the sort of road surfaces they just don't get abroad. Mitzie.

Cut to linkman at desk with Viking on one side and a knight in armour on the other.

Linkman

And now for the latest report on Picasso's progress over to Reg Moss on the Guildford by-pass.

Reg Moss standing with hand mike by fairly busy road.

Reg Moss

Well there's no sign of Picasso at the moment, David. But he should be through here at any moment. However I do have with me Mr Ron Geppo, British Cycling Sprint Champion and this year's winner of the Derby-Doncaster rally.

Geppo is in full cyclist's kit.

Geppo

Well Reg, I think Pablo should be all right provided he doesn't attempt anything on the monumental scale of some of his earlier paintings, like Guernica or Mademoiselles d'Avignon or even his later War and Peace murals for the Temple of Peace chapel at Vallauris, because with this strong head wind I don't think even Doug Timpson of Manchester Harriers could paint anything on that kind of scale.

Reg Moss

Well, thank you Ron. Well, there still seems to be no sign of Picasso, so I'll hand you back to the studio.

Linkman

Well, we've just heard that Picasso is approaching the Tolworth roundabout on the A3 so come in Sam Trench at Tolworth.

Cut to Sam Trench at roadside.

Trench

Well something certainly is happening here at Tolworth roundabout, David. I can now see Picasso, he's cycling down very hard towards the roundabout, he's about 75-50 yards away and I can now see his painting... it's an abstract... I can see some blue some purple and some little black oval shapes... I think I can see...

A Pepperpot comes up and nudges him.

Pepperpot

That's not Picasso - that's Kandinsky.

Trench

excited

Trench

cylists pass in front of him

Trench

Piet Mondrian - just behind, Piet Mondrian the Neo-Plasticist, and then a gap, then the main bunch, here they come, Chagall, Max Ernst, Miro, Dufy, Ben Nicholson, Jackson Pollock and Bernard Buffet making a break on the outside here, Brancusi's going with him, so is Gericault, Ferdinand Leger, Delaunay, De Kooning, Kokoschka's dropping back here by the look of it, and so's Paul Klee dropping back a bit and, right at the back of this group, our very own Kurt Schwitters..

Pepperpot

He's German!

Trench

But as yet absolutely no sign of Pablo Picasso, and so from Tolworth roundabout back to the studio.

Toulouse-Lautrec pedals past on a child's tricycle.

Cut back to studio.

Linkman

Well I think I can help you there Sam, we're getting reports in from the AA that Picasso, Picasso has fallen off...he's fallen off his bicycle on the B2127 just outside Ewhurst, trying to get a short cut through to Dorking via Gomslake and Peashall. Well, Picasso is reported to be unhurt, but the pig has a slight headache. And on that note we must say goodnight to you. Picasso has failed in his first bid for international cycling fame. So from all of us here at the 'It's the Arts' studio, it's goodnight. Goodnight.

Cut to a suburban house in a rather drab street. Zoom into upstairs window. Seriuos documentary music. Interior of a small room. A bent figure (Michael) huddles over a table, writing. He is surrounded by bits of paper. The camera is situated facing the man as he writes with immense concentration lining his unshaven face.

Voice Over

This man is Ernest Scribbler... writer of jokes. In a few moments, he will have written the funniest joke in the world... and, as a consequence, he will die ... laughing.

Ernest stops writing, pauses to look at what he has written... a smile slowly spreads across his face, turning very, very slowly to uncontrolled hysterical laughter... he staggers to his feet and reels across room helpless with mounting mirth and eventually collapses and dies on the floor.

Voice Over

It was obvious that this joke was lethal... no one could read it and live ...

The scribbler's mother (Eric) enters. She sees him dead, she gives a little cry of horror and bends over his body, weeping. Brokenly she notices the piece of paper in his hand and (thinking it is a suicide note - for he has not been doing well for the last thirteen years) picks it up and reads it between her sobs. Immediately she breaks out into hysterical laughter, leaps three feet into the air, and falls down dead without more ado. Cut to news type shot of commentator standing in front of the house.

This morning, shortly after eleven o'clock, comedy struck this little house in Dibley Road. Sudden ...violent ... comedy. Police have sealed off the area, and Scotland Yard's crack inspector is with me now.

Inspector

I shall enter the house and attempt to remove the joke.

At this point an upstairs window in the house is flung open and a doctor, with stetoscope, rears his head out, hysterical with laughter, and dies hanging over the window sill. The commentator and the inspector look up briefly and sadly, and then continue as if they are used to such sights this morning.

Inspector

I shall be aided by the sound of sombre music, played on gramophone records, and also by the chanting of laments by the men of Q Division ...

Inspector

he indicates a little knot of dour-looking policemen standing nearby

Inspector

The atmosphere thus created should protect me in the eventuality of me reading the joke.

He gives a signal. The group of policemen start groaning and chanting biblical laments. The Dead March is heard. The inspector squares his shoulders and bravely starts walking into the house.

Commentator

There goes a brave man. Whether he comes out alive or not, this will surely be remembered as one of the most courageous and gallant acts in police history.

The inspector suddenly appears at the door, helpless with laughter, holding the joke aloft. He collapses and dies.

All through the winter of '43 we had translators working, in joke-proof conditions, to try and produce a German version of the joke. They worked on one word each for greater safety. One of them saw two words of the joke and spent several weeks in hospital. But apart from that things went pretty quickly, and we soon had the joke by January, in a form which our troops couldn't understand but which the Germans could.

This time while he is out of sight, the sound of him running is the sound of someone running along a prison corridor, followed by a big door opening and closing.He appears again only two sand dunes away. Still running towards camera he disappears again from sight. This time there is a loud metallic series of sounds followed by a pig squealing. He appears over the nearest dune and runs up to camera.

CAPTION: 'PART 2'

CAPTION: 'SHEEP'

A small set of a gate in the country overlooking a field. A real rustic in smock and floppy hat is leaning on the gate. A city gent on holiday appears behind him. Off-screen baa-ing noises throughout.

City Gent

Good afternoon.

Rustic

Afternoon.

City Gent

A lovely day isn't it.

Rustic

Eh, 'tis that.

City Gent

You here on holiday or...?

Rustic

Nope, I live 'ere.

City Gent

Oh, jolly good too.

City Gent

surveys field; he looks puzzled

City Gent

are

City Gent

sheep aren't they?

Rustic

Ar.

City Gent

Yes, yes of course, I thought so...only...er why are they up in the trees?

Rustic

A fair question and one that in recent weeks has been much on my mind. It's my considered opinion that they're nesting.

City Gent

Nesting?

City Gent

Like birds?

Rustic

Ar. Exactly. Birds is the key to the whole problem. It's my belief that these sheep are laborin' under the misapprehension that they're birds. Observe their behavior. Take for a start the sheeps' tendency to 'op about the field on their back legs.

Rustic

off-screen baa-ing

Rustic

sound of sheep plummeting

Rustic

baaaaaa...thump

Rustic

Talk about the blind leading the blind.

City Gent

But why do they think they're birds?

Rustic

Another fair question. One thing is for sure; a sheep is not a creature of the air. They have enormous difficulty in the comparatively simple act of perchin'.

Rustic

crash

Rustic

As you see. As for flight, its body is totally unadapted to the problems of aviation. Trouble is, sheep are very dim. Once they get an idea in their heads, there's no shifting it.

City Gent

But where did they get the idea from?

Rustic

From Harold. He's that sheep there over under the elm. He's that most dangerous of animals, a clever sheep. He's the ring-leader. He has realized that a sheep's life consists of standing around for a few months and then being eaten. And that's a depressing prospect for an ambitious sheep. He's patently hit on the idea of escape.

City Gent

Well why don't you just get rid of Harold?

Rustic

Because of the enormous commercial possibilities should he succeed.

Two Frenchmen stand in front of a diagram of a sheep adapted for flying. They speak rapidly in French, much of it pseudo.

First Frenchman

Bonsoir - ici nous avons les diagrammes modernes d'un mouton anglo-français ... maintenant ... baa-aa, baa-aa... nous avons, dans la tête, le cabinc. Ici, on se trouve le petit capitaine Anglais, Monsieur Trubshawe.

Second Frenchman

Vive Brian, wherever you are.

First Frenchman

D'accord, d'accord. Maintenant, je vous présente mon collègue, le pouf célèbre, Jean-Brian Zatapathique.

Transfers his moustache to Second Frenchman

Second Frenchman

Maintenant, le mouton ... le landing ... les wheels, bon.

Opens diagram to show wheels on sheep's legs.

First Frenchman

Bon, les wheels, ici.

Second Frenchman

C'est formidable, n'est ce pas ...

Second Frenchman

unintelligibly indicates motor at rear of sheep

First Frenchman

Les voyageurs ... les bagages ... ils sont ... ici!

Triumphantly opens the rest of the diagram to reveal the whole brilliant arrangement. They run round flapping their arms and baa-ing. Cut to pepperpots in supermarket with off-screen interviewer.

First Pepperpot

Oh yes, we get a lot of French people round here.

Second Pepperpot

Ooh Yes.

Third Pepperpot

All over yes.

Interviewer

And how do you get on with these French people?

First Pepperpot

Oh very well.

Fourth Pepperpot

So do I.

Third Pepperpot

Me too.

First Pepperpot

Oh yes I like them. I mean, they think well don't they? I mean, be fair - Pascal.

Second Pepperpot

Blaise Pascal.

Third Pepperpot

Jean-Paul Sartre.

First Pepperpot

Yes, Voltaire.

Second Pepperpot

Ooh! - René Descartes.

René Descartes is sitting thinking. Bubbles come from his head with 'thinks'. Suddenly he looks happy. In thought bubble appears 'I THINK THEREFORE I AM'. A large hand comes into the picture with a pin and pricks the thought bubble. It deflates and disappears. After a second René disappears too.

Interviewer and Arthur Frampton, in interview studio.

Interviewer

Good evening, I have with me, Mr Arthur Frampton, who has...Mr. Frampton, I understand that you...er...as it were...have er...well, let me put it another way...I believe Mr. Frampton that whereas most people have - er - two...two...you...you

Frampton

I'm sorry.

Interviewer

Ah yes, yes I see...Um, Are you quite comfortable?

Frampton

Yes fine, thank you.

Interviewer

Sshhh! Well Mr. Frampton I understand Mr Frampton, you have a... 50% bonus in the...in the region of what you said.

Frampton

I got three cheeks.

Interviewer

Yes, yes, Splendid, splendid. Well...we were wondering, Mr Frampton, if you...could...see your way clear...

Frampton

seeing a camera moving round behind him

Frampton

Here? What's that camera doing?

Interviewer

Er, nothing, nothing at all, sir. We were wondering if you could see your way clear...to giving us...a quick... a quick... visual... Mr Frampton, will you take your trousers down?

Frampton

slapping away a hand from off-screen

Frampton

'Ere, get off! I'm not taking me trousers down on television. Who do you think I am?

Interviewer

Please take them down.

Frampton

No.

Interviewer

Just a little bit.

Interviewer

No, er ahem...

Interviewer

firmly

Interviewer

Now look here Mr Frampton... It's perfectly easy for somebody just to come along here to the BBC simply claiming... that they have a bit to spare in the botty department...but the point is Mr. Frampton... our viewers need proof.

Frampton

I've been on Persian Radio...Get off! Arthur Figgis knows I've got three buttocks.

Interviewer

How?

Frampton

We go cycling together.

Cut to shot of two men riding tandem. The one behind (Graham) looks down, looks up and exclaims 'strewth'.

Interviewer

Good evening, I have with me, Mr Arthur Frampton, who... Mr. Frampton - I understand that you, as it were...well, let me put it another way...I believe Mr. Frampton that whereas most people...didn't we do this just now?

Frampton

Er...yes.

Interviewer

Well why didn't you

Frampton

I thought it was the continental version.

Announcer

Two noses?

Stock shot of audience of Woman's Institute type, applauding. A man flourishing a handferchief blows his nose. Then he puts his handkerchief inside his shirt and blows again. Stock shot of women applauding again.

Compère

Ladies and gentlemen isn't she just great eh, wasn't she just great. Ha, ha, ha, and she can run as fast as she can sing, ha, ha, ha. And I'm telling you - 'cos I know. No, only kidding. Ha, ha, ha. Seriously now, ladies and gentlemen, we have for you one of the most unique acts in the world today. He's...well I'll say no more, just let you see for yourselves...ladies and gentlemen, my very great priviledge to introduve Arthur Ewing, and his musical mice.

Cut to Ewing

Ewing

Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. Ladies and gentlemen. I have in this box twenty-three white mice. Mice which have been painstakingly trained over the past few years, to squeak at a selected pitch.

Ewing

he raises a mouse by its tail

Ewing

This is E sharp... and this one is G. You get the general idea. Noe these mice are so arranged upon this rack, that when played in the correct order they will squeak 'The Bells of St Mary's'. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you on the mouse organ 'The Bells of St Mary's'. Thank you.

He produces two mallets. He starts striking the mice while singing quietly 'The Bells of St Mary's'. Each downward stroke of the mallet brings a terribly squashing sound and the expiring squeak. It is quite clear that he is slaughtering the mice. The musical effect is poor. After the first few notes people are shouting 'Stop it, stop him someone, Oh my God'. He cheerfully takes a bow. He is hauled off by the floor manager.

Cut to a man holding up cards saying 'Marriage Counsellor'. The counsellor sits behind a desk. He puts down the card and says:

Counsellor

Next!

A little man enters, with a beautiful blond buxom wench, in the full bloom of her young womanhood (Carol Cleveland)

Man

Are you the marriage guidance counsellor?

Counsellor

Yes. Good morning

Man

Good morning, sir

Counsellor

stares at the wife, fascinated

Counsellor

pauses, he shrugs himself out of it, says to man...

Counsellor

Name?

Man

Mr and Mrs Arthur Pewtey, Pewtey.

Counsellor

writes without looking down, just stares at the wife

Counsellor

holds up hand

Counsellor

Wait. Don't tell me - it's something to do with moonlight - it goes with her eyes - it's soft and gentle, warm and yeilding, deeply lyrical and yet tender and frightened like a tiny whit rabbit

Man

It's Deirdre

Counsellor

Deirdre. What a beautiful name. What a beautiful, beautiful name

Counsellor

leans across and lightly brushes his hand accross the wife's cheek

Counsellor

And what seems to be the trouble with your marriage Mr Pewtey?

Man

Well, it all started about five years ago when we started going on holiday to Brighton together. Deirdre, that's my wife, has always been a jolly good companion to me and I never particularly anticipated any marital strife - indeed the very idea of consulting a professional marital adviser has always been of the greatest repugnance to me although far be it from me to impugn the nature of your trade or profession

The counsellor and wife are not listening, fascinated by each other.

Counsellor

realizing Pewtey has stopped

Counsellor

Do go on.

Man

Well, as I say, we've always been good friends, sharing the interests, the gardening and so on, the model aeroplanes, the sixpenny bottle for the holiday money, and indeed twice a month settling down in the evenings doing the accounts, something which, er, Deirdre, Deirdre that's my wife, er, particularly looked forward to on account of her feet

Man

the counsellor has his face fantastically close to the wife's, as close that they could get without kissing

Man

I should probably have said at the outset that I'm noted for having something of a sense of humour, although I have kept myself very much to myself over the last two years notwithstanding, as it were, and it's only as comparatively recently that I began to realize - well, er prehaps realize is not the correct word, er, imagine, imagine, that I was not the only thing in her life

Counsellor

who is practically in a clinch with her

Counsellor

You suspected your wife?

Man

Well yes - at first, frankly yes

Man

the counsellor points the wife to a screen; she goes behind it

Man

Her behaviour did seem at the time to me, who after all was there to see, to be a little odd.

Counsellor

Odd?

Man

Yes well, I mean to a certain extent yes. I'm not by nature a suspicious person - far from it - though in fact I have something of a reputation as an after-dinner speaker, if you take my meaning....

A piece of his wife's clothing comes over the top of the screen.

Counsellor

Yes I certainly do

The wife's bra and panties come over the screen.

Man

Anyway in the area where I'm known people in fact know me extremely well....

Counsellor

taking his jacket off

Counsellor

Oh yes. Would you hold this.

Man

Certainly yes

Man

helps him with it; the counsellor continues to undress

Man

Anyway, as I said, I decided to face up to the facts and stop beating about the bush or I'd never look myself in the bathroom mirror again.

Counsellor

down to his shorts

Counsellor

Er, look would you mind running along for ten minutes? Make it half an hour.

Man

No, no, right-ho, fine. Yes I'll wait outside shall I?...

Man

the cousellor has already gone behind the screen

Man

Yes, well that's p'raps the best things. Yes. You've certainly put my mind at rest on one or two points, there.

Exits through door. He is stopped by a deep southern American voice.

Southener

Now wait there stranger. A man can run and run for year after year until he realizes      that what he's running from...is hisself

Man

Gosh.

Southener

A man's got to do what a man's got to do, and there ain't no sense in runnin'. Now      you gotta turn, and you gotta fight, and you gotta hold your head up high.

Man

Yes!

Southener

Now you go back in there my son and be a man. Walk tall.

Southener

he exits

Man

Yes, I will. I will. I've been pushed around long enough. This is it. This is your monent Arthur Pewtey - this is it Arthur Pewtey. At last you're a man!

Man

open the door very determinedly

Man

All right, Dierdre, come out of there

Counsellor

Go away

Man

Right. Right.

He is hit on the head with a chicken by a man in a suit of armour.

Queen Victoria Film: the texture of the film reproduces as accurately as possible an animated Victorian photograph. Queen Victoria (Terry J) and Gladstone (Graham) are walking on the lawn in front of Osborne.

Voice Over

These historic pictures of Queen Victoria, taken in 1880 at Osborne show the Queen with Gladstone. This unique film provides a rare glimpse into the private world of a woman who ruled half the earth. The commentary, recorded on the earliest wax cylinders, is spoken by Alfred Lord Tennyson, the Poet Laureate.

Cut to sitting room straight out of D. H. Lawrence. Mum, wiping her hand on her apron is ushering in a young man in a suit. They are a Northern couple.

Dad

Aye ... I like yer fancy suit. Is that what they're wearing up in Yorkshire now?

Ken

It's just an ordinary suit, father... it's all I've got apart from the overalls.

Dad turns away with an expression of scornful disgust.

Mum

How are you liking it down the mine, Ken?

Ken

Oh it's not too bad, mum... we're using some new tungsten carbide drills for the      preliminary coal-face scouring operations.

Mum

Oh that sounds nice, dear...

Tungsten carbide drills! What the bloody hell's tungsten carbide drills?

It's something they use in coal-mining, father.

Ken

Oh that's good.

Dad

Good!

Dad

What do you know about it? What do you know about getting up at five      o'clock in t'morning to fly to Paris... back at the Old Vic for drinks at twelve, sweating the day      through press interviews, television interviews and getting back here at ten to wrestle with the      problem of a homosexual nymphomaniac drug-addict involved in the ritual murder of a well      known Scottish footballer. That's a full working day, lad, and don't you forget it!

Mum

Oh, don't shout at the boy, father.

Dad

Aye, 'ampstead wasn't good enough for you, was it? ... you had to go poncing off to      Barnsley, you and yer coal-mining friends.

Dad

Coal-mining is a wonderful thing father, but it's something you'll never understand. Just      look at you!

Oh come on lad! Come on, out wi' it! What's wrong wi' me?... yet

Ken

And look what you've done to mother! She's worn out with meeting film stars, attending      premieres and giving gala luncheons...

One day you'll realize there's more to life than culture... There's dirt, and smoke, and good honest sweat!

Dad

Get out! Get out! Get OUT! You ... LABOURER!

Ken goes. Shocked silence. Dad goes to table and takes the cover off the typewriter.

Dad

Hey, you know, mother, I think there's a play there .... get t'agent on t'phone.

Interviewer

Good evening, and welcome once again to the Epilogue. On the programme this evening we have Monsignor Edward Gay, visiting Pastoral Emissary of the Somerset Theological College and author of a number of books about belief, the most recent of which is the best seller 'My God'. And opposite him we have Dr Tom Jack: humanist, broadcaster, lecturer and author of the book 'Hello Sailor'. Tonight, instead of discussing the existence or non-existence of God, they have decided to fight for it. The existence, or non-existence, to be determined by two falls, two submissions, or a knockout. All right boys, let's get to it. Your master of ceremonies for this evening - Mr Arthur Waring.

Man

very slowly and painfully

Man

Well it's not a question of wanting to be a mouse... it just sort of happens to you. All of a sudden you realize... that's what you want to be.

Interviewer

And when did you first notice these... shall we say... tendencies?

Man

Well... I was about seventeen and some mates and me went to a party, and, er...      we had quite a lot to drink... and then some of the fellows there ... started handing ... cheese      around ... and well just out of curiosity I tried a bit ... and well that was that.

Interviewer

And what else did these fellows do?

Man

Well some of them started dressing up as mice a bit ... and then when they'd got      the costumes on they started ... squeaking.

Interviewer

Yes. And was that all?

Man

That was all.

Interviewer

And what was your reaction to this?

Man

Well I was shocked. But, er... gradually I came to feel that I was more at ease ... with other mice.

Kargol

Well, we psychiatrist have found that over 8% of the population will always be mice, I mean, after all, there's something of the mouse in all of us. I mean, how many of us can honestly say that at one time or another he hasn't felt sexually attracted to mice.

The remainder of this film was taken secretly at one of these mouse parties by a      BBC cameraman posing as a vole. As usual we apologize for the poor quality of the film.

Very, poor quality film, shadowy shapes, the odd mouse glimpsed.

Well, er, then you steal some cheese, Brie or Camembert, or Cheddar or      Gouda, if you're on the harder stuff. You might go and see one of the blue cheese films...      there's a big clock in the middle of the room, and about 12:50 you climb up it and then      ...eventually, it strikes one... and you all run down.

Sound of baa-ing. The linkman looks up in air, looks startled, pulls a gun from under the      desk and fires in the air. The body of a sheep falls to the floor.

Courtroom: a judge sitting at higher level and a prisoner in the dock.

Judge

Mr Larch, you heard the case for the prosecution. Is there anything you wish to say before I pass sentence?

Prisoner

Well... I'd just like to say, m'lud, I've got a family... a wife and six kids... and I hope very much you don't have to take away my freedom... because... well, because m'lud freedom is a state much prized within the realm of civilized society.

Prisoner

slips into Olivier impression

Prisoner

It is a bond wherewith the savage man may charm the outward hatchments of his soul, and soothe the troubled breast into a magnitude of quiet. It is most precious as a blessed balm, the saviour of princes, the harbinger of happiness, yea, the very stuff and pith of all we hold most dear. What frees the prisoner in his lonely cell, chained within the bondage of rude walls, far from the owl of Thebes? What fires and stirs the woodcock in his springe or wakes the drowsy apricot betides? What goddess doth the storm toss'd mariner offer her most tempestuous prayers to? Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

Judge

It's only a bloody parking offence.

The counsel strides into court.

Counsel

I'm sorry I'm late m'lud I couldn't find a kosher car park. Er... don't bother to recap m'lud, I'll pick it up as we go along. Call Mrs Fiona Lewis.

A pepperpot walks into the court and gets up into the witness box.

I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so anyway, I said to her, I said, they can't afford that on what he earns, I mean for a start the feathers get up your nose, I ask you, four and six a pound, and him with a wooden leg, I don't know how she puts up with it after all the trouble she's had with her you-know-what, anyway it was a white wedding much to everyone's surprise, of course they bought everything on the hire purchase, I think they ought to send them back where they came from, I mean you've got to be cruel to be kind so Mrs Harris said, so she said, she said, she said, the dead crab she said, she said. Well, her sister's gone to Rhodesia what with her womb and all, and her youngest, her youngest as thin as a filing cabinet, and the goldfish, the goldfish they've got whooping cough they keep spitting water all over their Bratbys, well, they do don't they, I mean you can't, can you, I mean they're not even married or anything, they're not even divorced, and he's in the KGB if you ask me, he says he's a tree surgeon but I don't like the sound of his liver, all that squeaking and banging every night till the small hours, his mother's been much better since she had her head off, yes she has, I said, don't you talk to me about bladders, I said...

During all this counsel has been trying to ask questions. Eventually he gives up and Mrs. Lewis is pushed out of court still talking.

Judge

Mr Bartlett, I fail to see the relevance of your last witness.

Counsel

My next witness will explain that if m'ludship will allow. I call the late Arthur Aldridge.

Clerk of the Court

The late Arthur Aidridge.

Judge

The late Arthur Aldridge?

Counsel

Yes m'lud.

A coffin is brought into the court and laid across the witness box.

Judge

Mr Bartlett, do you think there is any relevance in questioning the deceased?

Counsel

I beg your pardon m'lud.

Judge

Well, I mean, your witness is dead.

Counsel

Yes, m'lud. Er, well, er, virtually, m'lud.

Judge

He's not completely dead?

Counsel

No he's not completely dead m'lud. No. But he's not at all well.

Judge

But if he's not dead, what's he doing in a coffin?

Counsel

Oh, it's purely a precaution m'lud - if I may continue? Mr Aldridge, you were a... you are a stockbroker of 10 Savundra Close, Wimbledon.

Counsel

from the coffin comes a bang

Counsel

Mr Aldridge...

Judge

What was that knock?

Counsel

It means 'yes' m'lud. One knock for 'yes', and two knocks for 'no'. If I may continue? Mr Aldridge, would it be fair to say that you are not at all well?

Counsel

Counsel

No further questions m'lud.

Judge

What do you mean, no further questions? You can't just dump a dead body in my court and say 'no further questions'. I demand an explanation.

Counsel

There are no easy answers in this case m'lud.

Judge

I think you haven't got the slightest idea what this case is about.

Counsel

M'lud the strange, damnable, almost diabolic threads of this extraordinary tangled web of intrigue will shortly m'lud reveal a plot so fiendish, so infernal, so heinous ...

Judge

Mr Bartlett, your client has already pleaded guilty to the parking offence.

Counsel

Parking offence, schmarking offence, m'lud. We must leave no stone unturned. Call Cardinal Richelieu.

Judge

Oh, you're just trying to string this case out. Cardinal Richelieu?

Counsel

A character witness m'lud.

Fanfare of trumpets. Cardinal Richelieu enters witness box in beautiful robes.

Cardinal

'Allo everyone, it's wonderful to be 'ere y'know, I just love your country. London is so beautiful at this time of year.

Counsel

Er, you are Cardinal Armand du Piessis de Richelieu, First Minister of Louis XIII?

Cardinal

Oui.

Counsel

Cardinal, would it be fair to say that you not only built up the centralized monarchy in France but also perpetuated the religious schism in Europe?

Cardinal

modestly

Cardinal

That's what they say.

Counsel

Did you persecute the Huguenots?

Counsel

And did you take even sterner measures against the great Catholic nobles who made common cause with foreign foes in defence of their feudal independence?

Cardinal

I sure did that thing.

Counsel

Cardinal. Are you acquainted with the defendant, Harold Larch?

Cardinal

Since I was so high

Cardinal

indicated how high

Cardinal

.

Counsel

Speaking as a Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church, as First Minister of Louis XIII, and as one of the architects of the modern world already - would you say that Harold Larch was a man of good character?

Cardinal

Listen. Harry is a very wonderful human being.

Counsel

M'lud. In view of the impeccable nature of this character witness may I plead for clemency.

Judge

Oh but it's only thirty shillings.

Enter Inspector Dim.

Cardinal

Bonjour Monsieur Dim.

Dim

So-called Cardinal, I put it to you that you died in December 1642.

Cardinal

That is correct.

Dim

Ah ha! He fell for my little trap.

Court applauds and the Cardinal looks dismayed.

Cardinal

Curse you Inspector Dim. You are too clever for us naughty people.

Dim

And furthermore I suggest that you are none other than Ron Higgins, professional Cardinal Richelieu impersonator.

Cardinal

It's a fair cop.

Counsel

My you're clever Dim. He'd certainly taken me in.

Dim

It's all in a day's work.

Judge

With a brilliant mind like yours, Dim, you could be something other than a policeman.

Dim

Yes.

He mimes window cleaning movements and the rest of the court enthusiastically mimes and sings the chorus again with him. When the chorus verse ends the counsel enthusiastically takes over but this time the court all sit and watch him as though he has gone completely mad.

He makes engine miming movements. As before. After a few seconds he sees that the rest of the court are staring at him in amazement and he loses momentum rapidly, almost as rapidly as he loses confidence and dignity. At last he subsides. Our knight in armour walks up to the counsel and hits him with the traditional raw chicken.

This man is no ordinary man. This is Mr. F. G. Superman. To all appearances, he looks like any other law-abiding citizen.

Pull back to reveal he is in a modern street full of Supermen walking along shopping, waiting at bus queues etc. F. G. Superman gets onto a bus. The bus is full of Supermen, most of them with shopping baskets on their knees. F. G. Supermen finds a seat...during the commentary the camera slowly tracks in on his face.

But Mr F. G. Superman has a secret identity...when trouble strikes at any time...at any place...he is ready to become... Bicycle Repair Man!

The camera is by now in very tight close-up. A country lane. A superman rides into the shot on a bicycle, whistling innocently. Suddenly he veers off to one side and crashes down into a ditch.

Cut to a laundrette. Pan along a row of Supermen, one or two of whom are poring over magazines such as: 'The Adventures of an Insurance Broker', 'Income Tax Comics', and 'The Grocer'. Suddenly the door flies open and a youngish Superboy bursts in dramatically.

A cartoon advertising 'Interesting Lives' leads to film of milkman (Michael) delivering milk to a suburban house. As he puts the milk down, the front door opens and a seductively dressed young lady (Carol) beckons him inside. Glancing round furtively he follows her into the house and up the stairs. She leads him to the bedroom door, opens it, and ushers him inside, closing the door behind him. Inside, he is bewildered to see several elderly milkmen, who have obviously been there for a very long time.

The Board of Trade has ratified a Trade Agreement with the Soviet Union for the sale of 600 low gear electric sewing machines. The President of the Board of Trade said he hoped this would mark a new area of expansion in world trade and a new spirit of co-operation between East and West. There has been a substantial drop in Gold Reserves during the last twelve months.

Janet

Now don't do a thing with it love, just put it in the bin over there.

Janet

Yes take my word for it, Marge. Kevin's eaten most of the early nineteenth-century British landscape artists, and I've learned not to worry. As a matter of fact, I feel a bit peckish myself.

Janet

she breaks a bit off the Turner

Janet

Yes...

Marge also tastes a bit.

Marge

I never used to like Turner.

Janet

Janet

No ... I don't know much about art, but I know what I like.

Man

Well, it's my only line.

Cut to a gentleman in striped blazer, boater and cricket flannels walking down to beach clutching towel and bathing trunks. He puts his towel on a breakwater next to another towel and starts to change. He suddenly looks up and we see everyone on the beach has turned to watch him - not with any disapproval - just a blank English stare. He grabs his towel off the breakwater and starts to take his trousers off under that. Girl in a bikini has been sitting on other side of the breakwater, stands up looking for her towel. She sees that the man is using it and she whisks it off him leaving him clutching his half-down trousers. Shot of everyone staring at him again. He pulls them up and makes for a beach hut... embarrassed. He goes into beach hut. Inside he is about to take his trousers off, when he becomes aware of a pair of feet which come up to the back of the beach hut - there is a 6-inch gap along bottom - and stop as if someone was peering through the crack. The man looks slightly outraged and pulls his trousers up, goes outside and edges cautiously round to the back of the beach hut. There he finds a man (Michael) bending close to the side of the beach hut with his hand to his face. The Gentleman kicks him hard in the seat of the pants. The man turns in obvious surprise, to reveal he was merely trying to light his cigarette out of the wind. The gentleman backs away with embarrassed apologies. We cut to the front of the beach hut to see gentleman backing round at the same time as a large matronly woman marches into the hut... the man follows her in. He is promptly thrown out on his ear. In desperation he looks around. On the promenade he suddenly sees an ice-cream van. He walks up to it, looks around, then nips behind to start changing. At the same time a policeman (Graham) strolls up to the ice-cream van and tells it to move on. The van drives off, exposing the gentleman clutching his trousers around his ankles. Close-up policeman's reaction. The man hurriedly pulls trousers up as policeman approaches him pulling out note book. Still covered in confusion he runs away from the policeman. In long shot we see him approach the commissionaire of the Royale Palace De Luxe Hotel. He whispers to the commissionaire, indicates by mime that he wants to take his trousers off. The commissionaire reacts to the gesture. The man nods. The commissionaire starts to take his trousers off. Man backs away once more in confusion - he has been misunderstood. Back on the beach again. He hides behind a pile of deckchairs. At that moment a beach party of jolly trippers arrive and each takes one. The deckchair pile rapidly disappears leaving the gentleman once again exposed. He dashes behind the deckchair attendant's hut which is next to him. Enter two workmen who dismantle it. Desperate by now he goes onto the pier. He goes into the amusement arcade, looking around furtively. Nips behind a 'what the butler saw' machine. Woman comes and puts penny in and starts to look, beckons over husband; he comes, looks in the machine, sees the man changing his trousers. They chase him off. Still pursued he nips into door. Finds himself in blackness. Relieved - at last he has found somewhere to change. He relaxes and starts to take his trousers off. Suddenly hears music and applause... curtains swishes back to reveal he is on stage of the pier pavilion. The audience applauds. Resigned to his fate, he breaks into stiptease routine.

I can see that. What's the matter with them?

Flu...flu? They should eat more fresh fruit.

RSM

RSM

throws him a banana

RSM

Now, it's quite simple to defend yourself against the banana fiend. First of all, you force him to drop the banana, next, you eat the banana, thus disarming him. You have now rendered him helpless.

Second Man

Suppose he's got a bunch.

RSM

Shut up!

Fourth Man

Supposing he's got a pointed stick.

RSM

Shut up. Right now you, Mr Apricot.

First Man

Harrison.

RSM

Harrison, Mr. Harrison. Come at me with that banana then. Come on attack me with it. As hard as you like. Come on.

RSM

Harrison moves towards him rather half-heartedly

RSM

Harrison runs towards him shouting; RSM draws a revolver and fires it, right in Harrison's face; Harrison dies immediately, falling to the ground; RSM puts gun away and walks to banana

RSM

Now...I eat the banana.

He does so; the rest of the class gather around Mr Harrison's body

All

You shot him. He's dead...dead. He's completely dead. You've shot him.

RSM

RSM

I have now eaten the banana. The deceased Mr Apricot is now disarmed.

RSM

Well, he was attacking me with a banana.

Third Man

Well, you told him to.

RSM

Look, I'm only doing me job. I have to show you how to defend yourselves against fresh fruit.

Fourth Man

And pointed sticks.

RSM

Shut up.

Second Man

Supposing someone came at you with a banana and you haven't got a gun?

RSM

Run for it.

Third Man

You could stand and scream for help.

RSM

You try that with a pineapple down your windpipe.

Third Man

I won't.

Third Man

You shot Mr. Harrison.

RSM

That was self-defence. Come on. I promise I won't shoot you.

Fourth Man

You promised you'd tell us about pointed sticks.

RSM

Shut up. Now. Brandish that...brandish that raspberry. Come on, be as vicious as you like with it. Come on.

Third Man

RSM

Third Man

Oh yes, you have.

RSM

I haven't.

Third Man

Throw it away.

throws it away

RSM

Third Man

You were going to shoot me!

RSM

I wasn't.

Third Man

You were.

RSM

Wasn't. Come on, come on you worm...you miserable little man. Come at me then...come on, do your worst, you worm.

RSM

third man runs at him; the RSM steps back and pulls a lever; a sixteen-ton weight falls upon the man

RSM

If anyone ever attacks you with a raspberry, simply pull the lever...and a sixteen-ton weight will drop on his head. I learnt that in Malaya.

Second Man

Suppose you haven't got a sixteen-ton weight?

RSM

Well that's planning, isn't it? Forethought.

Second Man

How many sixteen-ton weights are there?

RSM

Look...look, smarty pants, the sixteen-ton weight is just one way of dealing with the raspberry killer. There are millions of others!

Fourth Man

Like what?

RSM

Shoot him.

Second Man

Well, supposing you haven't got a gun or a sixteen-ton weight?

RSM

All right clever dick, all right clever dick. You two, come at me with raspberries, there you are, a whole basket each. Come on, come at me with them, then.

I promise I won't kill you. Now, are you going to attack me?

Second Man and Fourth Man

All right.

RSM

Right, now don't rush me this time. I'm going to turn me back. So you can stalk me...right. Come up as quietly as you can, right, close up behind me, then, in with the raspberries, right? Start moving

RSM

they start to creep up behind him

RSM

he presses button and a tiger flashes past him in direction of second and fourth men; cries are heard from them as well as roaring

RSM

he turns to lok at the scene

RSM

Right...I know you're there - lurking under the floorboards with your damsons and your prunes...now, the rest of you - I know you're hiding behind the wall bars with your quinces. Well I'm ready for you. I've wired myself up to two hundred tons of gelignite, and if any one of you so much as tries anything we'll all go up together! I've warned you...I warned you, right. That's it...

Bad luck.

Van der Berg

All right ... where are the fillings? Answer me, where are they?

Arthur

This is quite exciting.

Brian enters carrying a bazooka. Brian is dressed in operating-theatre clothes, gown, cap and mask, with rubber gloves and white wellingtons.

Brian

Not so fast.

All

Arthur

Ooh, what's that?

The Others

It's a bazooka.

Brian

All right. Get against the wall Van der Berg ... and you nurse. And the first one to try anything moves to a practice six feet underground ... this is an anti-tank gun ... and it's loaded ...and you've just got five seconds to tell me ... whatever happened to Baby Jane?

All

What?

Brian

Oh ... I'm sorry ... my mind was wandering ... I've had a terrible day... I really have ... you've got five seconds to tell me... I've forgotten. I've forgotten.

Bookseller

The five seconds haven't started yet have they?

Van der Berg

Only we don't know the question.

Arthur

Was it about Vogler?

Brian

No, no... no ... you've got five seconds to tell me...

Van der Berg

About Nigel?

Brian

No.

Big Cheese

And because I'm so evil you'll all die the slow way ... under the drill.

Arthur

Big Cheese

So it is. Lunch break, everyone back here at two.

They, all happily relax and walk off. Arthur surreptitiously goes to telephone and, making sure nobody is looking, calls.

Arthur

Hallo ... give me the British Dental Association ... and fast.

Cut to Arthur dressed normally as dentist leaning over patient in chair. He looks up to camera.

Arthur

You see, I knew there was something going on. Of course, the Big Cheese made two mistakes. First of all he didn't recognize me: Lemming, Arthur Lemming, Special Investigator, British Dental Association, and second ...

Arthur

Elderly couple, Mr A and Mrs B are staring through french windows at a cat that is sitting in the middle of their lawn motionless and facing away from them. A car is heard drawing up.

Mr A

Oh good, that'll be the Vet, dear.

Mrs B

I'd better go and let him in.

Mrs B goes out and comes back into the room with the Vet.

Mrs B

stage whisper

Mrs B

It's the Vet, dear.

Mr A

Oh very glad indeed you could come round, sir.

Vet

Not at all. Now what seems to be the problem? You can tell me - I'm a Vet, you know.

Mrs B

See! Tell him, dear.

Mr A

Well...

Mrs B

It's our cat. He doesn't do anything. He just sits out there on the lawn.

Vet

Is he ... dead?

Mr A

Oh, no!

Vet

to camera dramaticaly

Vet

Thank God for that. For one ghastly moment I thought I was... too late. If only more people would call in the nick of time.

Mrs B

He just sits there, all day and every day.

Mr A

And at night.

Mrs B

Sh! Almost motionless. We have to take his food out to him.

Mr A

And his milk.

Mrs B

Sh! He doesn't do anything. He just sits there.

Vet

Are you at your wits' end?

Mrs B

Definitely, yes.

Vet

Hm. I see. Well I think I may be able to help you. You see ...

Vet

he goes over to armchair, puts on spectacles, sits, crosses legs and puts finger tips together

Vet

... your cat is suffering from what we Vets haven't found a word for. His condition is typified by total physical inertia, absence of interest in its ambience - what we Vets call environment - failure to respond to the conventional external stimuli - a ball of string, a nice juicy mouse, a bird. To be blunt, your cat is in a rut. It's the old stockbroker syndrome, the suburban fin de siecle ennui, angst, weltschmertz, call it what you will.

Mrs B

Moping.

Vet

In a way, in a way ... hum ... moping, I must remember that. Now, what's to be done? Tell me sir, have you confused your cat recently?

Mr A

Well we ...

Mrs B

Sh! No.

Vet

Yes ... well I think I can definitely say that your cat badly needs to be confused.

Mrs B

What?

Mr A

Sh! What?

Vet

Confused. To shake it out of its state of complacency. I'm afraid I'm not personally qualified to confuse cats, but I can recommend an extremely good service. Here is their card.

Move, move, move. One, two, one, two, get those funny things off.

The workmen are completing the erection of a proscenium with curtains in front of the still immobile cat. A and B watch with awe. The arrangements are completed. All stand ready.

Sergeant

Stage ready for confusing, sir!

General

Very good. Carry on, sergeant.

Sergeant

Left turn, double march!

General

Right men, confuse the ... cat!

Drum roll and cymbals. The curtains draw back and an amazing show takes place, using various tricks: locked camera, fast motion, jerky motion, jump cuts, some pixilated motion etc. Long John Silver walks to front of stage.

Long John Silver

My lords, ladies and Gedderbong.

Long John Silver disappears. A pause. Two boxers appear. They circle each other. On one's head a bowler hat appears, vanishes. On the other's a sterve-pipe hat appears. On the first's head is a fez. The stove-pipe hat becomes a stetson. The fez becomes a cardinal's hat. The stetson becomes a wimple. Then the cardinal's hat and the wimple vanish. One of the boxers becomes Napoleon and the other boxer is astonished. Napoleon punches the boxer with the hand inside his jacket. The boxer falls, stunned. Horizontally he shoots off stage. Shot of cat, watching unimpressed. Napoleon does one-legged pixilated dance across stage and off, immediately reappearinng on other side of stage doing same dance in same direction. He reaches the other side, but is halted by a traffic policeman. The policeman beckons onto the stage a man in a penguin skin on a pogostick. The penguin gets halfway across and then turns into a dustbin. Napoleon hops off stage. Policeman goes to dustbin, opens it and Napoleon gets out. Shot of cat, still unmoved. A nude man with a towel round his waist gets out of the dustbin. Napoleon points at ground. A chair appears where he points. The nude man gets on to the chair, jumps in the air and vanishes. Then Napoleon points to ground by him and a small cannon appears. Napoleon fires cannon and the policeman disappears. The man with the towel round his waist gets out of the dustbin and is chased off stage by the penguin on the pogostick. A sedan chair is carried on stage by two chefs. The man with the towel gets out and the penguin appears from the dustbin and chases him off. Napoleon points to sedan chair and it changes into dustbin. Man in towel runs back on to stage and jumps in dustbin. He looks out and the penguin appears from the other dustbin and hits him on the head with a raw chicken. Shot of cat still unimpressed. Napoleon, the man with the towel round his waist, the policeman, a boxer, and a chef suddenly appear standing in a line, and take a bow. They immediately change positions and take another bow. The penguin appears at the end of the line with a puff of smoke. Each one in turn jumps in the air and vanishes. Shot of passive cat.

Cut to Mr A and Mrs B watching with the general.

General

I hope to God it works. Anyway, we shall know any minute now.

After a pause, the cat gets up and walks into the house. Mr A and Mrs B are overcome with joy.

Mrs B

I can't believe it.

Mr A

Neither can I. It's just like the old days.

Mrs B

Then he's cured. Oh thank you, general.

Mr A

What can we ever do to repay you?

General

No need to, sir. It's all in a day's work for 'Confuse-a-Cat'.

Picture freezes and over still of general's face are superimposed the words 'Confuse-a-Cat Limited'. Dramatic music. The words start to roll, like ordinary credits but read:

Man

No! Oh, yes, yes - yes.

Officer

Anything to declare?

Man

Yes ... no! No! No! No! Nothing to declare, no, nothing in my suitcase no...

Officer

No watches, cameras, radio sets?

Man

Oh yes ... four watches ... no, no, no. No. One... one watch...No, no. Not even one watch. No, no watches at all. No, no watches at all. No precision watches, no.

Officer

Which country have you been visiting, sir?

Man

Switzerland ... er ... no ... no ... not Switzerland ... er ... not Switzerland, it began with S but it wasn't Switzerland... oh what could it be? Terribly bad memory for names. What's the name of that country where they don't make watches at all?

Officer

Spain?

Man

Spain! That's it. Spain, yes, mm.

Officer

The label says 'Zurich', sir.

Man

Yes well ... it

Man

Switzerland, yes mm ... mm ... yes.

Officer

Switzerland - where they make the watches.

Man

Oh, nice shed you've got here.

Officer

Have you, er, got any Swiss currency, sir?

Man

No... just the watches... er just my watch, er, my watch on the currency... I've kept a watch on the currency, and I've watched it and I haven't got any.

Officer

That came out a bit glib didn't it?

Officer

an alarm clock goes off inside his case; the Man thumps it, unsuccessfully

Officer

Have you got an alarm clock in there, sir?

Man

No, no, heavens no, no... just vests.

Man

he thumps the case and the alarm stops

Officer

Sounded a bit like an alarm going off.

Man

Well it can't have been... it must be a vest, er, going off.

Officer

Going off?

Clocks start ticking and chiming in the case. The man desperately thumps the case.

Man

All right, I confess, I'm a smuggler ... This whole case is crammed full of Swiss watches and clocks. I've been purposely trying to deceive Her Majesty's Customs and Excise. I've been a bloody fool.

Officer

I don't believe you, sir.

Man

It's true. I'm, er, guilty of smuggling.

Officer

Don't give me that, sir ... you couldn't smuggle a piece of greaseproof paper let alone a case full of watches.

Man

What do you mean! I've smuggled watches before, you know! I've smuggled bombs, cameras, microfilms, aircraft components, you name it - I've smuggled it.

Officer

Now come along please, you're wasting our time... move along please.

Man

Look!

Man

he opens his case to reveal it stuffed full of watches and clocks

Man

Look - look at this.

Officer

Look, for all I know, sir, you could've bought these in London before you ever went to Switzerland.

Man

What? I wouldn't buy two thousand clocks.

Officer

People do, now close your case move along please come on. Don't waste our time, we're out to catch the real smugglers. Come on.

Man

shouting

Man

he is removed struggling

A vicar is next.

Vicar

Poor fellow. I think he needs help.

Officer

Right, cut the wisecracks, vicar. Get to the search room, and strip.

Cut to chairman of discussion group.

Chairman

Well to discuss the implications of that sketch and to consider the moral problems raised by the law-enforcement methods involved we have a duck, a cat and a lizard. Now first of all I'd like to put this question to you please, lizard. How effective do you consider the legal weapons employed by legal customs officers, nowadays?

Chairman

shot of lizard; silence

Chairman

shot of duck; silence

Chairman

shot of cat; silence

Chairman

shot of lizard again and then back

Chairman

No. Well, er, let's ask the man in the street what he thinks.

Man in Street

Well, er, speaking

Man in Street

Wagh!

Man

What was the question again?

Voice Over

Just how relevant are contemporary customs regulations and currency restrictions in a modern expanding industrial economy?

Voice Over

no answer

Voice Over

Oh never mind.

Pepperpot

Well I think customs men should be armed, so they can kill people carrying more than two hundred cigarettes.

Man

Man

Man

I mean if I want to eat a squirrel now and again, that's me own business, innit? I mean, I'm no racialist. I, oh, oh...

The knight is carrying a raw chicken. The man apprehensively covers his head and the knight slams him in the stomach with the chicken.

Woman

I think it's silly to ask a lizard what it thinks, anyway.

Chairman

off

Chairman

Why?

Woman

I mean they should have asked Margaret Drabble.

Young Man

very reasonably

Young Man

Well I think, er, customs people are quite necessary, and I think they're doing quite a good job really. Check.

We now see that he is playing chess with another young man. They are in an ordinary flat. There is a tremendous battering, banging, hammering and clattering at the door.

Young Man

Door's open.

Policeman

Oh. Yes.

Policeman

he enters

Policeman

All right. All right, all right, all right. My name's Police Constable Henry Thatcher, and this is a raid. I have reason to believe that there are certain substances on the premises.

Young Man

Well what sort of substances, officer?

Policeman

Er... certain substances.

Young Man

Well, what sort of certain substances?

Policeman

Er, certain substances of an illicit nature.

Young Man

Er, could you be more specific?

Policeman

I beg your pardon?

Young Man

Could you be 'clearer'.

Policeman

Oh, oh ... yes, er ... certain substances on the premises. To be removed for clinical tests.

Young Man

Have you got anything patiticular in mind?

Policeman

Well what have you got?

Young Man

Nothing, officer.

Policeman

You are Sandy Camp the actor?

Young Man

Yes.

Policeman

I must warn you, sir, that outside I have police dog Josephine, who is not only armed, and trained to sniff out certain substances, but is also a junkie.

Young Man

What are you after ... ?

Policeman

pulling a brown paper package from out of his pocket, very badly and obviously

Policeman

Oo! Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! Here is a brown paper bag I have found on the premises. I must confiscate this, sir, and take it with me for clinical examination.

Young Man

Wait a minute. You just got that out of your pocket.

Policeman

What?

Young Man

takes it

Young Man

Young Man

Sandwiches.

Policeman

Sandwiches? Blimey. Whatever did I give the wife?

Dear BBC, East Grinstead, Friday. I feel I really must write and protest about that sketch. My husband, in common with a lot of people of his age, is fifty. For how long are we to put up with these things. Yours sincerely, E. B. Debenham (Mrs).

Berlin air lift ... moral upheaval of Profumo case ... young hippies roaming the streets, raping, looting and killing. Yours etc., Brigadier Arthur Gormanstrop (Mrs).

Pepperpot

Well I think they should attack things, like that - with satire. I mean Ned Sherrin. Fair's fair. I think people should be able to make up their own minds for me.

Woman Journalist

Well I think they should attack the fuddy-duddy attitudes of the lower middle classes which permit the establishment to survive and keep the mores of the whole country back where they were in the nineteenth century and the ghastly days of the pre-sexual revolution.

A boxer (Eric) runs up and knocks her out.

Scotsman

Well that's, er, very interesting, because, er, I am, in fact, made entirely of wood.

Stockbroker

Well I think they should attack the lower classes, er, first with bombs, and rockets destroying their homes, and then when they run helpless into the streets, er, mowing them down with machine guns. Er, and then of course releasing the vultures. I know these views aren't popular, but I have never courted popularity.

'Match of the Day' music. We see a couple. They are standing at the foot of a largish bed. She is in bra and pants. He is in Y-fronts. They kiss ecstaticaly. After a few seconds there is the sound of a car drawing up. The crunch of footsteps on gravel and the sound of a door opening. The newsreader comes into shot.

Newsreader

Ah, I, Um terribly sorry it's not in fact 'Match of the Day'-, it is in fact edited highlights of tonight's romantic movie. Er. Sorry.

Boss

Right ... this is the plan then. At 10:45 .. you, Reg, collect me and Ken in the van, and take us round to the British Jewellery Centre in the High Street. We will arrive outside the British Jewellery Centre at 10:50 a of m. I shall then get out of the car, you Reg, take it and park it back here in Denver Street, right? At 10:51, I shall enter the British Jewellery Centre, where you, Vic, disguised as a customer, will meet me and hand me £5.18.3d. At 10:52, I shall approach the counter and purchase a watch costing £5.18.3d. I shall then give the watch to you, Vic. You'll go straight to Norman's Garage in East Street. You lads continue back up here at 10:56 and we rendezvous in the back room at the Cow and Sickle, at 11:15. All right, any questions?

Well, look at that bank job last week.

Boss

What was wrong with that?

Larry

Well having to go in there with a mask on and ask for £15 out of my deposit account; that's what was wrong with it.

Boss

Listen! What are you trying to say, Larry?

Larry

Couldn't we just steal the watch, Boss

Boss

Oh, you dumb cluck! We spent weeks organizing this job. Reg rented a room across the road and filmed the people going in and out every day. Vic spent three weeks looking at watch catalogues...until he knew the price of each one backwards, and now I'm not going to risk the whole raid just for the sake of breaking the law.

Larry

Urr... couldn't we park on a double yellow line?

Boss

No!

Larry

Couldn't we get a dog to foul the foot...

Reg

suddenly going pale

Reg

'Ere, Boss!

Boss

What's the matter with you?

Reg

I just thought... I left the car on a meter... and it's...

Boss

Overdue?

Reg

Yes, Boss.

Boss

How much?

Reg

quaking

Reg

I dunno, Boss... maybe two ... maybe five minutes ...

Boss

Five minutes overdue. You fool! You fool! All right ... we've no time to lose. Ken - shave all your hair off, get your passport and meet me at this address in Rio de Janeiro Tuesday night. Vic - go to East Africa, have plastic surgery and meet me there. Reg - go to Canada and work your way south to Nicaragua by July. Larry - you stay here as front man. Give us fifteen minutes then blow the building up. All right, make it fast.

Larry

I can't blow the building up.

Larry

It's illegal.

Boss

Oh bloody hell. Well we'd better give ourselves up then.

Reg

We can't, Boss.

Reg

We haven't done anything illegal.

Cut to film. Exterior of bank. Three bandits rush out with swag etc. One of them stops to talk to camera raising mask off head.

Bandit

No I think being illegal makes it more exciting.

Second Bandit

Yes, I agree. I mean, if you're going to go straight you might as well be a vicar or something.

Cut to vicar, wheeling quickly round to reveal he has his hand in the restoration-fund box.

Vicar

What?

Cut to chartered accountant.

Chartered Accountant

I agree. If there were fewer robbers there wouldn't be so many of them, numerically speaking.

Cut to pepperpot.

Pepperpot

I think sexual ecstasy is over-rated.

Cut to Scotsman.

Scotsman

Well, how very interesting, because I'm now made entirely of tin.

Cut to Police Inspector Praline.

Praline

After a few more of these remarks, I shall be appearing in a sketch, so stay tuned.

Cut to policeman.

Policeman

It's the uniform that puts them off, that and my bad breath.

Cut to judge in full long wig and robes and a QC also wearing wig and robes.

Judge

matter of factly

Judge

We like dressing up, yes...

Cut to Inspector Praline.

Inspector Praline

Hello again. I am at present still on film, but in a few seconds I shall be appearing in the studio. Thank you.

Cut to studio. A door opens. Inspector Praline looks round door.

Praline

to camera

Praline

he walks in followed by Superintendent Parrot and goes to desk

Praline

Mr Milton? You are sole proprietor and owner of the Whizzo Chocolate Company?

Milton

I am.

Praline

Superintendent Parrot and I are from the hygiene squad.We want to have a word with you about your box of chocolates entitled the Whizzo Quality Assortment.

Milton

Ah, yes.

Praline

producing box of chocolate

Praline

If I may begin at the beginning. First there is the Cherry Fondue. This is extremely nasty, but we can't prosecute you for that.

Milton

Agreed.

Praline

Next we have number four, 'Crunchy Frog'.

Milton

An, yes.

Praline

Am I right in thinking there's a real frog in here?

Milton

Yes. A little one.

Praline

What sort of frog?

Milton

A dead frog.

Praline

Is it cooked?

Milton

No.

Praline

What, a raw frog?

Superintendent Parrot looks increasingly queasy.

Milton

We use only the finest baby frogs, dew-picked and flown from Iraq, cleansed in the finest quality spring water, lightly killed, and then sealed in a succulent Swiss quintuple smooth treble cream milk chocolate envelope, and lovingly frosted with glucose.

Praline

That's as may be, but it's still a frog!

Milton

What else?

Praline

Well don't you even take the bones out?

Milton

If we took the bones out it wouldn't be crunchy would it?

Praline

Superintendent Parrot ate one of those.

Parrot

Excuse me a moment.

Parrot

exits hurriedly

Praline

Well, the Superintendent thought it was an almond whirl. People won't expect there to be a frog in there. They're bound to think it's some sort of mock frog.

Milton

insulted

Milton

Mock frog? We use no artificial preservatives or additives of any kind!

Praline

Nevertheless, I must warn you that in future you should delete the words 'crunchy frog', and replace them with the legend, 'crunchy raw unboned real dead frog' if you want to avoid prosecution.

Milton

What about our sales?

Praline

I'm not interested in your sales! I have to protect the general public! Now what about this one.

Praline

superintendent enters

Praline

superintendent nods

Praline

exit superintendent

Praline

What sort of confection is this?

Milton

We use choicest juicy chunks of fresh Cornish ram's bladder, emptied, steamed, flavoured with sesame seeds, whipped into a fondue and garnished with lark's vomit.

Praline

Larks vomit?

Milton

Correct.

Praline

Well it don't say nothing about that here.

Milton

Oh yes it does, on the bottom of the box, after monosodium glutamate.

Praline

looking

Praline

Wel I hardly think this is good enough. I think it's be more appropriate if the box bore a great red label warning lark's vomit.

Milton

Our sales would plummet!

Praline

Well why don't you move into more conventional areas of confectionary, like praline or lime cream; a very popular flavor, I'm lead to understand.

Praline

superintendent exits

Praline

anthrax ripple! What's this one: 'spring surprise'?

Milton

Ah - now, that's our speciality - covered with darkest creamy chocolate. When you pop it into your mouth steel bolts spring out and plunge straight through both cheeks.

Praline

Well where's the pleasure in that? If people place a nice chocky in their mouth, they don't want their cheeks pierced. In any case this is an inadequate description of the sweetmeat. I shall have to ask you to accompany me to the station.

Milton

getting up from the desk and being led away

Milton

It's a fair cop.

Praline

Stop talking to the camera.

Milton

I'm sorry.

Supeintendent Parrot enters the room as Inspector Praline and Milton leave, and addresses the camera.

Parrot

If only the general public would take more care when buying its sweeties, it would reduce the number of man-hours lost to the nation and they would spend less time having their stomachs pumped and sitting around in public lavatories.

Announcer

The BBC would like to apologize for the extremely poor quality of the next announcement, only he's not at all well.

Parrot

We present 'The Dull Life of a City Stockbroker',

Cut to a nice suburban street. Inside the house a stockbroker (Michael) is finishing his breakfast. His attractive wife looks on. He picks up his hat, rises, kisses her goodbye, and leaves. As he does so, she takes off her wrap and two men dressed only in briefs (Graham and Terry J) step out of the kitchen cupboard. In the front garden the stockbroker bids his neighbour (Graham) good morning; as he moves off a large African native throws an assegai, killing the neighbour. The stockbroker, not noticing this, moves on. A high street: he walks into a newsagents. Behind the counter a naked young lady gives him his newspaper. Taking his change without apparently noticing her he leaves. A bus queue: the stockbroker is at the head of it; there are four people behind him. As they wait, the Frankenstein monster comes up behind them and works his way along the queue, killing each member as he goes. He has just reached the stockbroker - who has not seen him - when the bus arrives and the stockbroker gets on. On the bus: all the other passengers are uniformed soldiers. The bus drives along a road past explosions and gunfire. A hand grenade comes through the window and lands on the seat next to the stockbroker. The soldiers leave the bus rapidly; the stockbroker calmly leaves the bus and walks down the street, in which the soldiers are engaged in a pitched battle. The stockbroker hails a taxi; it stops. No driver is visible. The stockbroker gets in and it drives off. In the stockbroker's office: a secretary is dead across her typewriter with a knife in her back; at the back of the office a pair of legs swing gently from the ceiling; a couple are snogging at his desk. Unconcerned, the stockbroker sits down. Furtively he looks round, then takes from the desk drawer a comic-book entitled 'Thrills and Adventure'. We see the frames of the comic strip. A Superman-type character and a girl are shrinking from an explosion. She is saying 'My God, his nose just exploded with enough force to destroy his kleenex'. In the next frame, the Superman character is saying 'If only I had a kleenex to lend him - or even a linen handkerchief - but these trousers...!! No back pocket!' In the frame beneath, he flies from side to side attempting to escape; finally he breaks through, bringing the two frames above down on himself. Cut to a picture of a safety curtain. An animated man come in front of it and says:

Man

Coming right up - the theatre sketch - so don't move!

The front stalls of a theatre. It is a first night - a lot of people in dinner jackets etc. About three rows back there is a spare seat. A general rustle of programmes, chocolates and theatrical murmurs. Suddenly a Sioux Indian enters, clad only in loin cloth, wearing war paint and with a single strip of hair in the middle of his head and feather. He carries a bow and a quiver of arrows. He settles into the empty seat. The man next to him shifts uneasily and looks straight ahead. The Indian looks his neighbour up and down a couple of times.

Indian

always speaking with full gestures

Indian

Me heap want see play. Me want play start heap soon.

Man next to him nods.

Man

Yes well. I think it ... begins in a minute.

Indian

Indian

She fine actress ... she make interpretation heap subtle ... she heap good diction and timing ... she make part really live for Indian brave.

Man

Indian

My father - Chief Running Stag - leader of mighty Redfoot tribe - him heap keen on Michael Denison and Dulcie Gray.

Man

unwillingly drawn in

Man

Do you go to the theatre a lot?

Indian

When moon high over prairie ... when wolf howl over mountain, when mighty wind roar through Yellow Valley, we go Leatherhead Rep - block booking, upper circle - whole tribe get it on 3/6d each.

Man

That's very good.

Indian

Stage Manager, Stan Wilson, heap good friend Redfoot tribe. After show we go pow-wow speakum with director, Sandy Camp, in snug bar of Bell and Compasses. Him mighty fine director. Him heap famous.

Man

Oh - I don't know him myself.

Indian

Him say Leatherhead Rep like do play with Redfoot tribe.

Man

Oh that's good...

Indian

We do 'Dial M for Murder'. Chief Running Elk - him kill buffalo with bare hands, run thousand paces when the sun is high - him play Chief Inspector Hardy - heap good fine actor.

Man

You do a lot of acting do you?

Indian

Yes. Redfoot tribe live by acting and hunting.

Man

You don't fight any more?

Indian

Yes! Redfoot make war! When Chief Yellow Snake was leader, and Mighty Eagle was in land of forefather, we fight Pawnee at Oxbow Crossing. When Pawnee steal our rehearsal copies of 'Reluctant Debutante' we kill fifty Pawnee - houses heap full every night. Heap good publicity.

The lights start to dim. Auditorium chatter subsides.

Man

visibly relieved

Man

I think he's about to start now, thank God for that.

They both look towards stage. The overture starts.

Indian

leaning across

Indian

proffers box

Man

No, thank you very much.

Indian

helping himself

Indian

Hmmm - crunchy frog - heap good.

Cut to stage, house manager walks out in front of tabs. He is a very nice young man.

House Manager

Ladies and gentlemen. Before the play starts, I would like to apologize to you all, but unfortunately Miss Cicely Courtneidge is unable to appear, owing to...

He is suddenly struck in the chest by first one arrow and then another. He crumbles to the ground revealing half a dozen in his back. The air is filled with war-whoops and drum beats and screams. Cut to a working-class kitchen.

Mum

reading newspaper

Mum

D'you read that, Edgar?

Dad

What's that dear?

Mum

There's been another Indian massacre at Dorking Civic Theatre.

Dad

About time too dear...

Mum

'Those who were left alive at the end got their money back'.

Dad

That's what live theatre needs - a few more massacres...

Mum

'The police are anxious to speak to anyone who saw the crime, ladies with large breasts, or just anyone who likes policemen.'

Suddenly a policeman walks in between the couple and the camera.

Policeman

to camera

Policeman

Yes! Policemen make wonderful friends. So if you are over six feet tall and would like a friend, a pen friend, in the police force, here is the address to write to: 'Mrs Ena Frog, 8 Masonic Apron Street, Cowdenbeath'. Remember - policemen make wonderful friends. So write today and take advantage of our free officer. Thank you. And now for the next sketch.

The policeman removes his helmet, shakes it, proffers it to mum at the table. She takes out a small folded bit of paper, opens and reads.

Mum

A Scotsman on a horse.

Policeman

For Mrs Emma Hamilton of Nelson, a Scotsman on a horse.

A Scotsman (John) rides up to the camera and looks around puzzled. In long-shot we see him riding off. At a wee Scottish kirk another Scotsman (Michael) is waiting at the head of the aisle to be married. Intercut between first Scotsman galloping through the countryside and the wedding procession coming up the aisle. The wedding takes place; just as it finishes the first Scotsman rides up to the kirk and rushes in. The assembled congregation look at him in alarm as he surveys them; then he picks up Michael and carries him off. Cut to film of Women's Institute audience applauding.

ANIMATION,

which leads us to the 'Twentieth Century Vole' trademark. Cut to film producer's office. Six writers sitting round a table with one very impressive chair empty at the head of the table. They wait reverently. Suddenly the door of the room flies open and Larry Saltzberg, the film producer, walks in. The writers leap to their feet.

Larry

Good morning boys.

Writers

Good morning Mr Saltzberg.

They run to help him into his chair.

Larry

sitting

Larry

the writers are overcome

Larry

I want you to know that I've had an idea for the next movie I'm going to produce and I want you boys to write it.

The writers run and kiss him.

Writers

Thank you. Thank you.

Larry

Oh sit down! Sit down! Sit down! There'll be plenty of time for that later on. Now boys, here's my idea...

Larry

Get out!

Fifth Writer

Larry

If there's one thing I can't stand, it's a yes-man! Get out!

Larry

fifth writer leaves very fast, the others go very quiet

Larry

to sixth writer

Larry

What do you think?

Sixth Writer

Well... I...

Larry

Just because I have an idea it doesn't mean it's great. It could be lousy.

Sixth Writer

It could?

Larry

Yeah! What d'ya think?

Sixth Writer

It's lousy.

Larry

There you are, you see, he spoke his mind. He said my idea was lousy. It just so happens my idea isn't lousy so get out you goddam pinko subversive, get out!

Larry

sixth writer exits

Larry

looking straight at fourth writer

Fourth Writer

Well ... I think it's an excellent idea.

Larry

Are you a yes-man?

Fourth Writer

No, no, no, I mean there may be things against it.

You think it's lousy, huh?

Fourth Writer

No, no, I mean it takes time.

Larry

Larry

Are you being indecisive?

Fourth Writer

Yo. Nes. Perhaps.

Fourth Writer

Larry

I hope you three gentlemen aren't going to be indecisive!

Larry

Larry

What the hell are you doing under that table?

First Writer

First Writer

I feel fine now.

Larry

Well, what do you think?

Oh! Eh! You didn't ask me you asked him. He didn't ask me, he asked him. No, him.

I've changed my mind. I'm asking you, the one in the middle.

Second Writer

The one in the middle?

Larry

Yes, the one in the middle.

Larry

Larry

I'm thinking.

Larry

Get back in those seats immediately.

Second Writer

Second Writer

Er... er...

Larry

Come on!

Second Writer

Splunge.

Larry

Did he say splunge?

First and Third Writers

Yes.

Larry

What does splunge mean?

Larry

Good. Right . ..

Third Writer

Er. Splunge?

Larry

OK...

First Writer

Yeah. Splunge for me too.

Larry

So all three of you think splunge, huh?

Writers

Yes!

Larry

Well now we're getting somewhere. No, wait. A new angle! In the snow, instead of the tree, I see Rock Hudson, and instead of the dog I see Doris Day and, gentlemen, Doris Day goes up to Rock Hudson and she kisses him. A love story. Intercourse Italian style. David Hemmings as a hippy Gestapo officer. Frontal nudity. A family picture. A comedy. And then when Doris Day's kissed Rock Hudson she says something funny like...

Larry

looks at third writer

Third Writer

Er ... Good evening.

Larry

Doris Day's a comedienne, not a newsreader. Get out!

Larry

third writer runs

Larry

looks at second writer

Second Writer

Splunge?

Larry

That's the stupidest idea I ever heard. Get out!

Larry

second writer leaves

Larry

looks at first writer

First Writer

Er... er... er... I can't take it anymore.

First Writer

runs out

Larry

I like that! I like that, I can't take it any more, and then Rock Hudson says 'I'm a very rich film producer and I need a lobotomy' and then Doris Dog says 'I think you're very handsome and I'm going to take all my clothes off' and then Doris Dog turns into a yak and goes to the bathroom on David Lemming. No, wait, wait!

In the country. Interviewer with microphone. Behind him a man sits on a wall, with clip-board, binoculars and spotting gear.

Interviewer

Good evening. Tonight we're going to take a hard tough abrasive look at camel spotting. Hello.

Spotter

Hello Peter.

Interviewer

Now tell me, what exactly are you doing?

Spotter

Er well, I'm camel spotting. I'm spotting to see if there are any camels that I can spot, and put them down in my camel spotting book.

Interviewer

Good. And how many camels have you spotted so far?

Spotter

Oh, well so far Peter, up to the present moment, I've spotted nearly, ooh, nearly one.

Interviewer

Nearly one?

Spotter

Er, call it none.

Interviewer

Fine. And er how long have you been here?

Spotter

Three years.

Interviewer

So, in, er, three years you've spotted no camels?

Spotter

Yes in only three years. Er, I tell a lie, four, be fair, five. I've been camel spotting for just the seven years. Before that of course I was a Yeti spotter.

Interviewer

A Yeti spotter, that must have been extremely interesting.

Spotter

Oh, it was extremely interesting, very, very - quite... it was dull; dull, dull, dull, oh God it was dull. Sitting in the Waterloo waiting room. Course once you've seen one Yeti you've seen them all.

Interviewer

And have you seen them all?

Spotter

Well I've seen one. Well a little one... a picture of a... I've heard about them.

Interviewer

Well, now tell me, what do you do when you spot a camel?

Spotter

Er, I take its number.

Interviewer

Camels don't have numbers.

Spotter

Ah, well you've got to know where to look. Er, they're on the side of the engine above the piston box.

Interviewer

What?

Spotter

Ah - of course you've got to make sure it's not a dromedary. 'Cos if it's a dromedary it goes in the dromedary book.

Interviewer

Well how do you tell if it's a dromedary?

Spotter

Ah well, a dromedary has one hump and a camel has a refreshment car, buffet, and ticket collector.

Interviewer

Mr Sopwith, aren't you in fact a train spotter?

Spotter

What?

Interviewer

Don't you in fact spot trains?

Spotter

Oh, you're no fun anymore.

Cut to a small board meeting. An accountant stands up an reads...

Accountant

Lady Chairman, sir, shareholders, ladies and gentlemen. I have great pleasure in announcing that owing to a cutback on surplus expenditure of twelve million Canadian dollars, plus a refund of seven and a half million Deutschmarks from the Swiss branch, and in addition adding the debenture preference stock of the three and three quarter million to the directors' reserve currency account of seven and a half million, plus an upward expenditure margin of eleven and a half thousand lira, due to a rise in capital investment of ten million pounds, this firm last year made a complete profit of a shilling.

Chairman

A shilling Wilkins?

Accountant

Er, roughly, yes sir.

Chairman

Wilkins, I am the Chairman of a multi-million pound corporation and you are a very new chartered Accountant. Isn't it possible there may have been some mistake?

Accountant

Well that's very kind of you sir, but I don't think I'm ready to be Chairman yet.

Board Member

Wilkins, Wilkins. This shilling, is it net or gross?

Accountant

It's British sir.

Chairman

Yes, has tax been paid on it?

Accountant

Yes, this is after tax. Owing to the rigorous bite of the income tax five pence of a further sixpence was swallowed up in tax.

Board Member

Five pence of a

Board Member

Accountant

Yes sir.

Chairman

Five pence of a further

Chairman

Chairman

Then where is the other penny?

Accountant

... Er.

Board Member

That makes you a penny short Wilkins. Where is it?

Accountant

... Erm.

Chairman

Wilkins?

Accountant

in tears

Accountant

I embezzled it sir.

Chairman

What all of it?

Accountant

Yes all of it.

Board Member

You naughty person.

Accountant

It's my first. Please be gentle with me.

Chairman

I'm afraid it's my unpleasant duty to inform you that you're fired.

Accountant

Oh please, please.

Chairman

No, out!

Yes, there's no place for sentiment in big business.

A little joke, a little jest. Nothing to worry about ladies and gentlemen. Now we've got some science fiction for you, some sci-fi, something to send the shivers up your spine, send the creepy crawlies down your lager and limes. All the lads have contributed to it, it's a little number entitled, Science Fiction Sketch...

Zoom through the galaxy to the solar system.

American Voice

very resonant

American Voice

The Universe consists of a billion, billion galaxies... 77,000,000,000 miles across, and every galaxy is made up of a billion, zillion stars and around these stars circle a billion planets, and of all of these planets the greenest and the pleasantest is the planet Earth, in the system of Sol, in the Galaxy known as the Milky Way ... And it was to this world that creatures of an alien planet came ... to conquer and destroy the very heart of civilization...

camera pans off them; they both look disappointed; camera picks up instead a smart little business man, in bowler, briefcase and pinstripes

American Voice

... Harold Potter, gardener, and tax official, first victim of Creatures from another Planet.

Weird electronic music. Sinister atmosphere. Follow him out of station. Cut-away to flying saucer, over day skyline. Back to Potter as he walks up suburban road. Back to flying saucer. It bleeps as if it has seen its prey and changes direction. Cut back to Potter just about to open his front gate. Shot from over the other side of the road. Cut to flying saucer sending down ray. Potter freezes . . . shivers and turns into a Scotsman with kilt, and red beard. His hand jerks out in front of him and he spins round and scuttles up road in fast motion, to the accompaniment of bagpipe music. Cut to close-up of newspaper with banner headline: 'Man turns into a Scotsman'.

Newsvendor's Voice

Read all abaht it! Read all abaht it! Man turns into Scotsman!

Mix through to Potter's front gate. His wife is being interviewed by obvious plainclothes man.

Inspector

Mrs Potter - you knew Harold Potter quite well I believe?

Wife

Oh yes quite well.

Inspector

Yes.

Wife

He was my husband.

Inspector

Yes. And, er, he never showed any inclination towards being a Scotsman before this happened?

Wife

shocked

Wife

No, no, not at all. He was not that sort of person...

Inspector

He didn't wear a kilt or play the bagpipes?

Wife

No, no.

Inspector

He never got drunk at night or bought home black puddings?

Wife

No, no. Not at all.

Inspector

He didn't have an inadequate brain capacity?

Wife

No, no, not at all.

Inspector

I see. So by your account Harold Potter was a perfectly ordinary Englishman without any tendency towards being a Scotsman whatsoever?

Wife

Absolutely, yes.

Wife

suddenly remembering

Wife

Mind you he did always watch Dr Finlay on television.

Inspector

Ah-hah! ... Well that's it, you see. That's how it starts.

Wife

I beg your pardon?

Inspector

Well you see Scottishness starts with little things like that, and works up. You see, people don't just turn into a Scotsman for no reason at all...

Inspector

goes rigid: with Scots accent:

Inspector

No further questions!

The words are hardly out of his mouth when he turns into a Scotsman and spins round and disappears up road in fast motion. Pan with him. Cut to bus queue: man in a city suit and bowler hat suddenly changes into a Scotsman with beard, twizzles round and speeds out of shot. Cut to street policeman pointing way for woman with a pram. Suddenly he changes into a Scotsman and scuffles out of shot. She looks aghast for a moment and then she too changes into a Scotsman and hurtles off after him. The baby suddenly develops a beard and the pram follows her. Single shot of black jazz musician in cellar blowing a blues sax solo. He changes and whizzes off. Squad of soldiers being drilled. Suddenly they all change into bearded Scotsmen and race off in unison. Pan with them past sign: 'Welsh Guard'.

Quick animated shot of flying saucer disappearing over city skyline.

Cut to big close-up of passionate kiss. It goes on for some moments. Foggy lens... romantic music. Keep on big close-up as they talk. She is none too intelligent.

She

Charles

Darling...

She

Charles...

Charles

Darling, darling...

She

Charles... there's something I've got to tell you...

Charles

What is it darling?

She

It's daddy ... he's turned into a Scotsman...

Charles

What! Mr Llewellyn?

She

Yes, Charles. Help me, please help me.

Charles

But what can I do?

She

Surely, Charles, you're the Chief Scientist at the Anthropological Research Institute, at Butley Down - an expert in what makes people change from one nationality to another.

Charles

So I am!

Charles

pull out to reveal they are in a laboratory; he is in a white coat, she is in something absurdly sexy

Charles

This is right up my street!

She

Oh good.

Charles

Now first of all, why would anyone turn into a Scotsman?

She

tentatively

She

Em, for business reasons?

Charles

No, no! Only because he has no control over his own destiny! Look I'll show you...

He presses a button on a control board and a laboratory TV screen lights op with the words 'only because they have no control over their own destinies'.

She

I see.

Charles

Yes! So this means that some person or persons unknown is turning all these people into Scotsmen...

She

Oh, what kind of heartless fiend could

She

do

She

that to a man?

Charles

I don't know ... I don't know ... all I know is that these people are streaming north of the border at the rate of thousands every hour. If we don't act fast, Scotland will be choked with Scotsmen...

She

Ooh!...

Zoom in on her face. Cut to as many bearded Scotsmen as possible, hurtling through wood in fast motion. Follow them, ending up with skyline shot as per 'Seventh Seal'. They all still have the arm outstretched in front of them and as always they are accompanied by bagpipe music. Shot of border with large notice: 'Scotland Welcomes You'.

American Voice

Soon Scotland was full of Scotsmen. The over-crowding was pitiful.

They all dash across harder and then stop abruptly once they're over. They stand around looking lost.

American Voice

Three men to a caber.

Cut to three Scotsmen tossing one caber. Cut to Scots wife in bed with bearded husband. Pull back to reveal five other Scotsmen in the bed. Short but brilliant piece of animation from T. Gilliam to show England emptying of people and Scotland filling up, ending with a till sound and a till sign coming up out of England reading: 'Empty'. Track into England. Film of a deserted street. Wind, a dog sniffing, newspaper blowing along street. Close-up sign on shop door 'Gone to

Scotland'. Close-up another sign on a shop door.' 'McClosed'. Shop sign: McWoolworths & Co'.

American Voice

For the few who remained, life was increasingly difficult.

Man suddenly folds up newspaper and runs round corner. Re-emerges driving bus. Drives it halfway to stop and then leaps out with bus still moving. Runs to stop, and puts out hand. Bus stops. He leaps on, rings bell, runs round to front and drives the bus off again. As bus drives out of frame we just see a couple of Scotsmen flashing past camera with arms outstretched. Pan slowly round empty football stadium. Eventually we pick up a solitary spectator, halfway up and halfway along in stand opposite where the players come out. He suddenly leaps to his feet cheering. Cut to players tunnel and one player emerging and a referee with ball. They kick off. Player goes straight down field and scores.

Spectator disapppointed.

A quick shot of flying saucer again.

Studio: the laboratory again. Charles is looking through microscope, when the door flies open and she bursts in.

She

Charles! Thank goodness I've found you! It's mummy!

Charles

Hello mummy.

She

No, no, mummy's turned into a Scotsman...

Charles

Oh how horrible... Will they stop at nothing?

She

I don't know - do you think they will?

Charles

I meant that rhetorically.

She

What does rhetorically mean?

Charles

It means, I didn't expect an answer.

She

Oh I see. Oh, you're so clever, Charles.

Charles

Did mummy say anything as she changed?

She

with an air of tremendous revelation

She

Yes! she did, now you come to mention it

A long pause as he waits expectantly.

Charles

Well, what was it?

She

Oh, she said ... 'Them!'

She

thrilling chord of jangling music and quick zoom into her face

She

Is there someone at the door?

Charles

No ... It's just the incidental music for this scene.

She

Oh I see...

Charles

'Them' ... Wait a minute!

She

A

She

whole

She

minute?

Charles

No, I meant that metaphorically ... 'Them' ... 'Them' ... She was obviously referring to the people who turned her into a Scotsman. If only we knew who 'They' were ... And why 'They' were doing it... Who are 'Them'?

Crashing chord... cut to a small still of a Scottish crofier's cottage on a lonely moor. Slow zoom in on the cottage.

American Voice

Then suddenly a clue turned up in Scotland. Mr Angus Podgorny, owner of a Dunbar menswear shop, received an order for 48,000,000 kilts from the planet Skyron in the Galaxy of Andromeda.

Mix to interior of highland menswear shop. An elderly Scottish couple are poring over a letter which they have on the counter. Oil lamps etc.

Mrs Podgorny

Angus how are y'going to get 48,000,000 kilts into the van?

Angus

I'll have t'do it in two goes.

Mrs Podgorny

D'you not ken that the Galaxy of Andromeda is two million, two hundred thousand light years away?

Angus

Is that so?

Mrs Podgorny

Aye ... and you've never been further than Berwick-on-Tweed...

Angus

Aye ... but think o' the money dear ... £18.10.0d a kilt ...that's ...

Angus

calculates with abacus

Angus

£900,000,000 - and that's without sporrans!

Mrs Podgorny

Aye ... I think you ought not to go, Angus.

Angus

with visionary look in his eyes

Angus

Aye ... we'd be able to afford writing paper with our names on it... We'd be able to buy that extension to the toilet...

Mrs Podgorny

Aye ... but he hasn't signed the order yet, has he?

Angus

Who?

Mrs Podgorny

Ach ... the man from Andromeda.

Angus

Och ... well ... he wasna really a man, d'you ken ...

Creepy music starts to edge in.

Mrs Podgorny

narrowing eyes

Mrs Podgorny

Not really a man?

Angus

sweating as the music rises

Angus

He was as strange a thing as ever I saw, or ever I hope to see, God willing. He was a strange unearthly creature - a quivering, glistening mass...

Mrs Podgorny

Angus Podgorny, what

Mrs Podgorny

do

Mrs Podgorny

y'mean?

Angus

He wasna so much a man as... a blancmange!

Jarring chord.

Police station: a police sergeant is talking over the counter to a girl dressed in a short frilly tennis dress. She holds a racquet and tennis balls.

Sergeant

A blancmange, eh?

Girl

Yes, that's right. I was just having a game of doubles with Sandra and Jocasta, Alec and David...

Sergeant

Hang on!

Girl

What?

Sergeant

There's five.

Sergeant

Five people . . . how do you play doubles with five people?

Girl

Ah, well ... we were...

Sergeant

Sounds a bit funny if you ask me ... playing doubles with five people...

Girl

Well we often play like that... Jocasta plays on the side receiving service...

Sergeant

Oh yes?

Girl

Yes. It helps to speed the game up and make it a lot faster, and it means Jocasta isn't left out.

Sergeant

Look, are you asking me to believe that the five of you was playing doubles, when on the very next court there was a blancmange playing by itself?.

Girl

That's right, yes.

Sergeant

Well answer me this then - why didn't Jocasta play the blancmange at singles, while you and Sandra and Alec and David had a proper game of doubles with four people?

Girl

Because Jocasta always plays with us. She's a friend of ours.

Sergeant

Call that friendship? Messing up a perfectly good game of doubles?

Girl

It's not messing it up, officer, we like to play with five.

Sergeant

Look it's

Sergeant

your

Sergeant

affair if you want to play with five people ... but don't go calling it doubles. Look at Wimbledon, right? If Fred Stolle and Tony Roche played Charlie Pasarell and Cliff Drysdale and Peaches Bartcowitz... they wouldn't go calling it doubles.

Girl

But what about the blancmange?

Sergeant

That could play Ann Haydon-Jones and her husband Pip.

Cut back to Podgorny's shop. He and his wife are frozen in the positions in which we left them. They pick up the conversation as if nothing had happened.

Mrs Podgorny

Oh, a blancmange gave you an order for 48,000,000 kilts?

Angus

Aye!

Mrs Podgorny

And you

Mrs Podgorny

believed

Mrs Podgorny

it?

Angus

Aye, I did.

Mrs Podgorny

Och, you're a stupid man, Angus Podgorny.

Angus

getting a little angry

Angus

bet

Angus

I believe it.

Mrs Podgorny

Even if it's from a blancmange?

Angus

Och, woman, if a blancmange is prepared to come 2,200,000 light years to purchase a kilt, they must be fairly keen on kilts. So cease yer prattling woman and get sewing. This could be the biggest breakthrough in kilts since the Provost of Edinburgh sat on a spike. Mary, we'll be rich! We'll be rich!

Mrs Podgorny

Oh, but Angus... he hasna given you an earnest of his good faith!

Angus

Ah mebbe not but he has gi' me this...

Angus

brings out piece of folded paper from sporran

Mrs Podgorny

What is it now?

Angus

An entry form for the British Open Tennis Championships at Wimbledon Toon ... signed and seconded.

Mrs Podgorny

Och, but Angus, ye ken full well that Scots folk dinna know how to play the tennis to save their lives.

Angus

Aye, but I must go though dear, I dinna want to seem ungrateful.

Mrs Podgorny

Ach! Angus, I wilna let you make a fool o'yourself.

Angus

But I must.

Mrs Podgorny

Och, no you'll not ...

Close-up on Angus.

Angus

Oh, Mary...

Angus

suddenly we hear a strange creaking and a slurping noise; a look of horror comes into his eyes

Angus

Oh, oh, Mary! Look out! Look out!

Big close-up of Mrs Podgorny's eyes starting out from head.

Mrs Podgorny

Urrgh. It's the blancmange.

Blur focus.

Cut to a desk for police spokesman. A peaked-capped policeman sits there, reading 'The Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire' by Googie Withers. He lowers book and talks chattily to camera.

Policeman

Oh, now this is where Mr Podgorny could have saved his wife's life. If he'd gone to the police and told them that he'd been approached by unearthly beings from the Galaxy of Andromeda, we'd have sent a man round to investigate. As it was he did a deal with a blancmange, and the blancmange ate his wife. So if you're going out, or going on holiday, or anything strange happens involving other galaxies, just nip round to your local police station, and tell the sergeant on duty - or his wife - of your suspicions. And the same goes for dogs. So I'm sorry to have interrupted your exciting science fiction story ... but, then, crime's our business you know. So carry on viewing, and my thanks to the BBC for allowing me to have this little chat with you. Goodnight. God bless, look after yourselves.

He is hit on the head by knight in suit of armour with raw chicken.

Cut to CID office: a plainclothes detective is sitting in his office. Podgorny is sobbing.

Detective

softly and understandingly

Detective

Do sit down, Mr Podgorny... I... I ... think what's happened is ... terribly ... terribly... funny .... tragic. But you must understand that we have to catch the creature that ate your wife, and if you could help us answer a few questions, we may be able to help save a few lives. I know this is the way your wife would have wanted it.

He is sitting on the desk next to Podgorny. Podgorny with superhuman control makes a great effort to stop sobbing.

Angus

Aye ... I'll ... do ... my best, sergeant.

Detective

slapping Podgorny

Detective

Detective Inspector!

Angus

Er, detective inspector.

Detective

getting up and talking sharply and fast

Detective

Now then. The facts are these. You received an order for 48,000,000 kilts from a blancmange from the planet Skyron in the Galaxy of Andromeda ... you'd just shown your wife an entry form for Wimbledon, which you'd filled in... when you turned round and saw her legs disappearing into a blancmange. Is that correct?

Angus

Yes, sir.

Detective

Are you mad?

Angus

No, sir.

Detective

Well that's a relief. 'Cos if you were, your story would be less plausible.

Detective

detective brings out photograph of blancmange

Detective

Now then, do you recognize this?

Angus

with a squeak of fear

Angus

Oh yes. That's the one that ate my Mary!

Detective

Good. His name's Riley... Jack Riley... He's that most rare of criminals ... a blancmange impersonator and cannibal.

Angus

But what about the 48,000,000 kilts and the Galaxy of Andromeda?

Detective

I'm afraid that's just one of his stories. You must understand that a blancmange impersonator and cannibal has to use some pretty clever stories to allay suspicion.

Angus

Then you mean...

Detective

Yes.

Angus

But...

Detective

How?

Angus

Yes.

Detective

Well...

Angus

Not?

Detective

I'm afraid so.

Angus

Why?

Detective

Who knows?

Angus

Do you think?

Detective

Could be.

Detective

I know.

Angus

She was...

Suddenly, we hear a strange noise. Angus looks frightened. Detective narrows his eyes and walks over to the door.

Detective

Good lord what's that?

Detective

he opens the door and we get a close-up of his staring eyes

Detective

with sudden fear

Detective

Eh Riley? Riley! Riley! It's not Riley!

Eating noises. He is dragged out of camera shot. Refocus on Angus ... he averts his eyes as we hear the detective inspector off-screen.

Detective

off-screen

Detective

It's an extra-terrestial being! Agggh!

Jarring chord: Angus shuts his eyes.

Cut back to laboratory: she is sitting suggestively on a stool. He is pacing up and down looking intense.

Charles

So, everyone in England is being turned into Scotsmen, right?

She

Yes.

Charles

Now, which is the worst tennis-playing nation in the world?

She

Er ... Australia.

Charles

No. Try again.

She

Australia?

Charles

testily

Charles

No... try again but say a different place.

She

Oh, I thought you meant I'd said it badly.

Charles

No, course you didn't say it badly. Now hurry.

She

Er, Czechoslovakia.

Charles

No! Scotland!

She

Of course.

Charles

Now ... now these blancmanges, apart from the one that killed Mrs Podgorny have all appeared in which London suburb?

She

Finchley?

Charles

No. Wimbledon ... Now do you begin to see the pattern? With what sport is Wimbledon commonly associated?

She is thinking really hard.

Norman Hackforth

off-screen

Norman Hackforth

For viewers at home, the answer is coming up on your screens. Those of you who wish to play it the hard way, stand upside down with your head in a bucket of piranha fish. Here is the question once again.

Charles

With what sport is Wimbledon commonly associated?

SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'TENNIS'

She

Cricket.

Charles

No.

She

Pelote?

Charles

No. Wimbledon is most commonly associated with tennis.

She

Of course! Now I see!

Charles

Yes, it all falls into place!

She

The blancmangcs are really Australians trying to get the rights of the pelota rules from the Czech publishers!

Charles

heavily

Charles

No ... not quite ... but, er, just look in here.

He indicates microscope. As she eagerly bends to look into it he picks up a sock filled with sand and without looking strikes her casually over the head with it. She collapses out of sight under desk. He continues to think out loud.

Charles

Yes. So these blancmanges, blancmange-shaped creatures come from the planet Skyron in the Galaxy of Andromeda. They order 48,000,000 kilts from a Scottish menswear shop ... turn the population of England into Scotsmen (well known as the worst tennis-playing nation on Earth) thus leaving England empty

Cut to commentator in his box.

Commentator

Well, here at Wimbledon, it's been a most extraordinary week's tennis. The blancmanges have swept the board, winning match after match. Here are just a few of the results: Billie-Jean King eaten in straight sets, Laver smothered whole after winning the first set, and Poncho Gonzales, serving as well as I've never seen him, with some superb volleys and decisive return volleys off the back hand, was sucked through the net at match point and swallowed whole in just under two minutes. And so, here on the final day, there seems to be no players left to challenge the blancmanges. And this could be their undoing, Dan: as the rules of Wimbledon state quite clearly that there must be at least one human being concerned in the final.

Commentator

we see a three-foot-high blancmange being shepherded onto a tennis court by a Scotsman

Commentator

suddenly exalted

Commentator

there is a human with it. It's Angus Podgorny! The plucky little Scottish tailor ... upon whom everything depends. And so it's Podgorny versus blancmange in this first ever Intergalactic Wimbledon!

Cut to the centre court at Wimbledon or if we can't get it, number one will do. Blancmange and Podgorny on opposite sides net. Another blancmange sitting in umpire's chair. Blancmange serves... a real sizzling ace. Podgorny, who in any case is quivering with fear, doesn't see it.

Commentator's Voice

And it's blancmange to serve and it's a good one.

Blancmange Umpire

Blurb blurble blurb.

Fifteen love.

Blancmange serves again, and again Podgorny misses hopelessly and pathetically. Collage of speeded-up versions of blancmange sewing and Podgorny missing. Cut to scoreboard:

BLANCMANGE:

Commentator's Voice

And Podgorny fails to even hit the ball ... but this is no surprise as he hasn't hit the ball once throughout this match. So it's 72 match points to the blancmange now... Podgorny prepares to serve again.

Podgorny fails to serve and we see the scoreboard:

Commentator's Voice

This is indeed a grim day for the human race, Dan.

Just as Podgorny is about to serve we see Mr and Mrs Brainsample jump onto the court brandishing forks and spoons and with napkins tucked into their necks.

Commentator's Voice

But what's this? Two spectators have rushed onto the pitch with spoons and forks... what are they going to do?

Cut to laboratory.

Charles

They mean to eat the blancmange.

The girl pulls herself up from where she was slumped by microscope. He knocks her out again with a sand-filled sock. Cut back to Wimbledon. Mr and Mrs Brainsample chasing blancmange and eating it.

Commentator's Voice

And they're eating the blancmange ... Yes! The blancmange is leaving the court... it's abandoning the game! This is fantastic!

Cut to Mr and Mrs Brainsample covered in bits of blancmange and licking their fingers.

American Voice

Yes it was Mr and Mrs Samuel Brainsample, who, after only a brief and misleadling appearance in the early part of the film, returned to save the Earth ... but why?

Oh, well you see we love blancmanges. My wife makes them.

Mr Brainsample

Oh, yes. You see we're from the planet Skyron in the Galaxy of Andromeda, and they're all that size there. We tried to tell you at the beginning of the film but you just panned off us.

Cut back to Podgorny on court still trying to serve; at last he makes contact and runs backward and forward to receive his own services.

American Voice

So the world was saved! And Angus Podgorny became the first Scotsman to win Wimbledon... fifteen years later.

Well suppose some of your tanks was to get broken and troops started getting lost, er, fights started breaking out during general inspection, like.

Dino

It wouldn't be good for business would it, colonel?

Colonel

Are you threatening me?

Dino

Oh, no, no, no.

Luigi

Whatever made you think that, colonel?

Dino

The colonel doesn't think we're nice people, Luigi.

Luigi

We're your buddies, colonel.

Dino

We want to look after you.

Colonel

Look after me?

Luigi

We can guarantee you that not a single armoured division will get done over for fifteen bob a week.

Colonel

No, no, no.

Luigi

Twelve and six.

Luigi

Eight and six ... five bob...

Colonel

No, no this is silly.

Dino

What's silly?

Colonel

No, the whole premise is silly and it's very badly written. I'm the senior officer here and I haven't had a funny line yet. So I'm stopping it.

Dino

You can't do that!

Colonel

I've done it. The sketch is over.

Full frontal nudity? Yes I'd do it, if it was valid. Or if the money was valid, and if it were a very small part.

'BUT THERE LET US LEAVE THE ART CRITIC TO STRANGLE HIS WIFE AND MOVE ON TO PASTURES NEW'

After about ten seconds of mood setting the camera suddenly comes across the art critic strangling his wife in middle foreground. As the camera passes him he hums nervously and tries to look as though he isn't strangling anybody. The camera doesn't stop panning, and just as it goes off him we see him start strangling again. The pan carries on and catches up with a bridegroom carrying his bride across a field and finally arriving in a high street where, breathless and panting, he carries her through traffic and into a large department store. Finally cut to the furniture department of the store. The bridegroom and bride enter, he puts her down and addresses one of the assistants.

Groom

We want to buy a bed, please.

Mr Lambert

Og, certainly, I'll, I'll get someone to help you.

Mr Lambert

Mr Lambert

Mr Verity!

Mr Verity

Can I help you, sir?

Groom

Er yes. We'd like to buy a bed...a double bed...about fifty pounds?

Verity

Oh no, I'm afraid not, sir. Our cheapest bed is eight hundred pounds, sir.

Groom

Eight hundred pounds!

Lambert

Or, er, perhaps I should have explained. Mr Verity does tend to exaggerate, so every figure he gives you will be ten times too high. Otherwise he's perfectly all right, perfectly ha, ha, ha.

Groom

Oh I see. I see.

Groom

to Verity

Groom

So your cheapest bed then is eighty pounds?

Verity

Eight hundred pounds, yes, sir.

Groom

And how wide is it?

Verity

Er, the width is, er, sixty feet wide.

Groom

Oh...

Groom

laughing politely he mutters to wife

Groom

six foot wide, eh. And the length?

Verity

The length is ... er ...

Verity

calls off

Verity

Lambert! What is the length of the Comfydown Majorette?

Lambert

Er, two foot long.

Groom

Two foot long?

Verity

Ah yes, you have to remember of course, to multiply everything Mr Lambert says by three. Er, it's nothing he can help, you understand. Apart from that he's perfectly all right.

Groom

I see, I'm sorry.

Verity

But it does mean that when he says a bed is two foot wide, it is in fact sixty foot wide.

Groom

Oh, yes I see...

Verity

And that's not counting the mattress.

Groom

Oh, how much is that?

Verity

Er, Mr Lambert will be able to help you there.

Verity

calls

Verity

Lambert! Will you show these twenty good people the, er, dog kennels, please?

Lambert

Mm? Certainly.

Groom

Dog kennel? No, no, no, mattresses, mattresses!

Verity

Oh no, no you have to say dog kennel to Mr Lambert because if you say mattress he puts a bag over his head. I should have explained. Apart from that he's really all right.

They go to Lambert.

Groom

Ah, hum, er we'd like to see the dog kennels please.

Lambert

Dog kennels?

Groom

Yes, we want to see the dog kennels.

Lambert

Ah yes, well that's the pets' department. Second floor.

Groom

Oh, no, no, we want to see the

dog kennels

Groom

Lambert

Yes, pets department second floor.

Groom

No, we don't really want to see dog kennels only your colleague said we ought to...

Lambert

Oh dear, what's he been telling you now?

Groom

Well, he said we should say dog kennels instead of mattress.

Lambert puts bag over head

Groom

Oh dear. Hello?

Did you say mattress?

Groom

Well, a little yes.

Verity

I did

The manager enters.

Manager

Oh dear, did somebody say mattress to Mr Lambert?

Manager and Verity continue to sing. Lambert takes bag off head, manager exits after pointing a warning finger at bride and groom.

Groom

Oh

Groom

...yes.

Lambert

Well, if you meant mattress, why dodn't you

Lambert

say

Lambert

a mattress? I mean, it's very confusing for me if you go and say dog kennels when you mean mattress. Why not just say mattress?

Groom

Well, I mean you put a bag over your head last time I said mattress.

Bag goes on. Groom looks around guiltily. Verity walks in. Verity heaves a sigh, jumps in box. Manager comes in and joins him, they sing 'And did those feet...'. Another assistant comes in.

Assistant

Did somebody say mattress to Mr Lambert?

Verity

Twice.

Assistant

Hey, everybody, somebody said mattress to Mr Lambert, twice.

Colonel

Now, I've noticed a tendency for this programme to get rather silly. Now I do my best to keep things moving along, but I'm not having things getting silly. Those two last sketches I did got very silly indeed, and that last one about the bed was even sillier. Now, nobody likes a good laugh more than I do...except perhaps my wife and some of her friends...oh yes and Captain Johnston. Come to think of it most people likes a good laugh more than I do. But that's beside the point. Now, let's have a good clean healthy outdoor sketch. Get some air into your lungs. Ten, nine, eight and all that.

Cut to two hermits on a hillside.

First Hermit

Hello, are you a hermit by any chance?

Second Hermit

Yes that's right. Are you a hermit?

First Hermit

Yes, I certainly am.

Second Hermit

Well I never. What are you getting away from?

First Hermit

Oh you know, the usual - people, chat, gossip, you know.

Second Hermit

Oh I certainly do - it was the same with me. I mean there comes a time when you realize there's no good frittering your life away in idleness and trivial chit-chat. Where's your cave?

First Hermit

Oh, up the goat track, first on the left.

Second Hermit

Oh they're very nice up there, aren't they?

First Hermit

Yes they are, I've got a beauty.

Second Hermit

A bit drafty though, aren't they?

First Hermit

No, we've had ours insulated.

Second Hermit

Oh yes.

First Hermit

Yes, I used birds' nests, moss and oak leaves round the outside.

Second Hermit

Oh, sounds marvellous.

First Hermit

Oh it's a treat, it really is, 'cos otherwise those stone caves can be so grim.

Second Hermit

Yes they really can be, can't they? They really can.

First Hermit

Oh yes.

Third hermit passes by.

Third Hermit

Morning Frank.

Second Hermit

Morning Norman. Talking of moss, er you know Mr Robinson?

First Hermit

With the, er, green loin cloth?

Second Hermit

Er no, that's Mr Seagrave. Mr Robinson's the hermit who lodges with Mr Seagrave.

First Hermit

Oh I see, yes.

Second Hermit

Yes well he's put me onto wattles.

First Hermit

Really?

Second Hermit

Yes. Swears by them. Yes.

Fourth hermit passes by.

Fourth Hermit

Morning Frank.

Second Hermit

Morning Lionel. Well he says that moss tends to fall off the cave walls during cold weather. You know you might get a really bad spell and half the moss drops off the cave wall, leaving you cold.

First Hermit

Oh well, Mr Robinson's cave's never been exactly nirvana has it?

Second Hermit

Well, quite, that's what I mean. Anyway, Mr Rogers, he's the, er, hermit...

First Hermit

... on the end.

Second Hermit

. .. up at the top, yes. Well he tried wattles and he came out in a rash.

Second Hermit

Yes, and there's me with half a wall wattled, I mean what'll I do?

First Hermit

Well why don't you try birds nests like I've done? Or else, dead bracken.

Fifth Hermit

calling from a distance

Fifth Hermit

Frank!

Second Hermit

Yes Han.

Fifth Hermit

Can I borrow your goat?

Second Hermit

Er, yes that'll be all right. Oh leave me a pint for breakfast will you? ...

Second Hermit

to first hermit

Second Hermit

You see, you know that is the trouble with living half way up a cliff - you feel so cut off. You know it takes me two hours every morning to get out onto the moors, collect my berries, chastise myself, and two hours back in the evening.

First Hermit

Still there's one thing about being a hermit, at least you meet people.

Second Hermit

Oh yes, I wouldn't go back to public relations.

First Hermit

Oh well, bye for now Frank, must toddle.

Colonel

coming on

Colonel

Right, you two hermits, stop that sketch. I think it's silly.

Second Hermit

What?

Colonel

It's silly.

Second Hermit

What do you mean, you can't stop it - it's on film.

Colonel

That doesn't make any difference to the viewer at home, does it? Come on, get out. Out. Come on out, all of you. Get off, go on, all of you. Go on, move, move. Go on, get out. Come on, get out, move, move.

ANIMATION:

including dancing Botticelli Venus, which links to pet shop: Mr. Praline walks into the shop carrying a dead parrot in a cage. He walks to counter where shopkeeper tries to hide below cash register.

Praline

Hello, I wish to register a complaint...Hello? Miss?

Shopkeeper

What do you mean, miss?

Praline

Oh I'm sorry, I have a cold. I wish to make a complaint!

Shopkeeper

Sorry, we're closing for lunch.

Praline

Never mind that, my lad. I wish to complain about this parrot what I purchased not half an hour ago from this very boutique.

Shopkeeper

Oh yes, the, the Norwegian Blue. What's wrong with it?

Praline

I'll tell you what's wrong with it, my lad. It's dead, that's what's wrong with it!

Shopkeeper

No, no, it's resting, look!

Praline

Look my lad, I know a dead parrot when I see one, and I'm looking at one right now.

Shopkeeper

No no sir. it's not dead. It's resting!

Praline

Resting?

Shopkeeper

Yeah, remarkable bird, the Norwegian Blue, beautiful plumage, innit?

Praline

The plumage don't enter into it - it's stone dead.

Shopkeeper

No, no - it's just resting!

Praline

All right then, if it's restin', I'll wake him up!

Praline

shouts into cage

Praline

Hello Polly! I've got a nice cuttlefish for you when you wake up, Polly Parrot!

Shopkeeper

jogging the cage

Shopkeeper

There, it moved!

Praline

No, he didn't. That was you pushing the cage!

Shopkeeper

I did not.

Praline

Yes, you did!

Praline

takes parrot out of cage, shouts

Praline

bangs it against the counter

Praline

throws it in the air and lets it fall to the floor

Praline

Now that's what I call a dead parrot.

Shopkeeper

No, no. It's stunned.

Praline

Look my lad, I've had just about enough of this. That parrot is definitely deceased. And when I bought it not half an hour ago, you assured me that its lack of movement was due to it being tired and shagged out after a long squawk.

Shopkeeper

It's probably pining for the fjords.

Praline

Pining for the fjords, what kind of talk is that? Look, why did it fall flat on its back the moment I got it home?

Shopkeeper

The Norwegian Blue prefers kipping on it's back! Beautiful bird, lovely plumage!

Praline

Look, I took the liberty of examining that parrot, and I discovered the only reason that it had been sitting on its perch in the first place was that it had been nailed there.

Shopkeeper

Well of course it was nailed there. Otherwise it would muscle up to those bars and voom.

Praline

Look matey

Praline

picks up the parrot

Praline

this parrot wouldn't voom if you put four thousand volts through it! It's bleedin' demised!

Shopkeeper

It's not, it's pining!

Praline

It's not pining, it's passed on. This parrot is no more! It has ceased to be. It's expired and gone to meet its maker.This is a late parrot. It's a stiff. Bereft of life, it rests in peace. If you hadn't nailed it to the perch it would be pushing up the daisies. It's rung down the curtain and joined the choir invisible. This is an ex-parrot.

Shopkeeper

Well, I'd better replace it, then.

Praline

to camera

Praline

If you want to get anything done in this country you've got to complain till you're blue in the mouth.

Shopkeeper

Sorry guv, we're right out of parrots.

Praline

I see. I see. I get the picture.

Shopkeeper

pause

Shopkeeper

I got a slug.

Praline

Does it talk?

Shopkeeper

Not really, no.

Praline

Well, it's scarcely a replacement, then is it?

Shopkeeper

Listen, I'll tell you what,

Shopkeeper

Shopkeeper

tell you what, if you go to my brother's pet shop in Bolton he'll replace your parrot for you.

Well I wish to make a complaint. I got on the Bolton train and found myself deposited here in Ipswich.

Porter

Shopkeeper

Yes, yes.

Praline

It's not a palindrome. The palindrome of Bolton would be Notlob. It don't work.

Well you two are, and we've got a brace of guides called Jimmy Blenkinsop... because Kilimanjaro is a pretty tricky climb you know, most of it's up until you reach the very very top, and then it tends to slope away rather sharply. But Jimmy's put his heads together and worked out a way up.

Sir

opens door

Sir

Jimmy walks in wearing full climbing gear

Sir

I don't believe you've met. Jimmy Blenkinsop - Arthur Wilson, Arthur Wilson -Jimmy Blenkinsop... Arthur Wilson two -James Blenkinsop one, James Blenkinsop one - Arthur Wilson two. Carry on Jimmies.

Jimmy

to Bob, reassuring him

Jimmy

puts hand over eye

Jimmy

Jimmy proceeds to walk round the room clambering over every single piece of available furniture. He doesn't stop talking. Causing a complete wreckage, he clambers over the desk, onto a bookcase and round the room knocking furniture over, meanwhile he is saying..

Jimmy

Now the approach to Kilimanjaro is quite simply over the foothills, and then we go on after that to ... ohh... to set a base camp, somewhere in the region of the bottom of the glacier when...

Jimmy

Jimmy staggers out headlong through the door. There are loud crashing noises

Sir

He'll be leading the first assault.

Bob

Well I'm afraid I shan't be coming on your expedition sir, as I've absolutely no confidence in anyone involved in it.

Bob gets up and walks out slamming the door.

Sir

Oh dear.

Sir

pause - look over at other? Bob

Sir

Well how about you?

Bob

sitting in chair at other angle of desk

Bob

Well I'm game, sir.

Cut back to two sirs, double image, split screen.

Sir

So are we.

Cut to two announcers (Johns) at desks. They put telephones down, turns to camera, and announce:

Announcers

And now for aomething completely different - a man with a tape recorder up his brother's nose.

Cut to Michael on small stage as before, this time also with Graham. Michael puts a finger up Graham's nostril: we hear the Marseillaise. He removes it: the music stops. He puts a finger up Graham's other nostril, and we hear rewinding noises.

Voice Over

and CAPTION:

Voice Over

'AND NOW IN STEREO...'

Michael simultaneously puts a finger up his own nostril and a finger (on the other hand) up Graham's; we hear two recordings of the Marseillaise together (out of sync).

An animated sequence then leads us to a gents suburban hairdressing salon. A customer comes in. The barber is standing in a white coat washing his hands at a basin.

Customer

Morning.

Barber

flinching slightly

Barber

Ah ... good morning sir, good morning. I'll be with you in a minute.

Customer sits in barber's chair. Barber carries on washing. He seems to be over-thoroughly washing and rewashing his hands and lower arms. Barber turns and smiles humourlessly, at customer. At last he has finished washing. He dries his hands thoroughly, turns and comes over to the customer. There are very obvious blood stains on his coat and his lapel is torn off. One stain could be the mark of a bloodstained hand which has slipped down the length of it. He picks up a sheet and shakes it out. Sound of iron and heavy objects falling on the floor. He throws it around the customer. As he knots the sheet at the back he is about to pull it tight and strangle the customer. His face sweats, a wild look in his eyes. Then with a supreme effort he controls himself. Customer smiles reassuringly at him.

Barber

How... how would you like it, sir?

Customer

Just short back and sides please.

Barber

How do you do that?

Customer

Well it's just... ordinary short back and sides.

Barber

It's not a ... razor cut?

Barber

suddenly

Barber

controlling himself

Barber

sigh of relief

Barber

It's just a scissors.

Customer

Yes...

Customer

laughs, thinking the barber must be having a little joke

Barber

You wouldn't rather just have it combed, would you sir?

Customer

I beg your pardon?

Barber

You wouldn't rather forget all about it?

Customer

No, no, no, I want it cut.

At the word cut barber winces.

Barber

Cut, cut, cut, blood, spurt, artery, murder, Hitchcock, Psycho... right sir ... well ...

Barber

swallows hard

Barber

I'll just get everything ready. In the meanwhile perhaps you could fill in one of these.

He hands him a bit of paper; the barber goes to a cupboard and opens it.

Customer

All right, fine, yes.

On the inside of the door there is a large medical chart headed: 'Main Arteries'. His shaking hand traces the arteries and he looks occasionally back at the customer.

Customer

Excuse me, er...

Barber

What?

Customer

Where it says: 'next of kin' shall I put 'mother'?

Barber

Yes, yes ... yes.

Customer

Right there we are.

Customer

hands form to barber

Barber

Thank you.

He gets scissors and comb ready and comes up behind the customer and spreads his arms out, opening and shutting scissors as barbers do before cutting.

Barber

Right!

He can't bring himself to start cutting; after one or two attempts he goes to the cupboard again, gets a whisky bottle out and takes a hard swig. He comes up behind the customer again.

Barber

Ha, ha, ha ... there, I've finished.

Customer

What?

Barber

I've finished cutting... cutting... cutting your hair. It's all done,

Customer

You haven't started cutting it!

Barber

I have! I did it very quickly... your honour...

Barber

sir

Barber

... sir...

Customer

getting rather testy

Customer

Look here old fellow, I know when a chap's cut my hair and when he hasn't. So will you please stop fooling around and get on with it.

The barber bends down to the floor and drags out a tape recorder which he places behind the barber's chair, talking as he does so.

Barber

Yes, yes, I will, I'm going to cut your hair, sir. I'm going to start cutting your hair, sir, start cutting now!

He switches on tape recorder and then he himself cowers down against the wall as far from the chair as he can get, trembling.

Tape Recorder

Nice day, sir,

Customer

Yes, flowers could do with a drop of rain though, eh?

Tape Recorder

snip, snip

Tape Recorder

Did you see the match last night, sir?

Customer

Yes. Good game. I thought.

Tape Recorder

snip, snip, snip; sound of electric razor starting up

Tape Recorder

I thought Hurst played well sir.

Customer

straining to hear

Tape Recorder

razor stops

Tape Recorder

I thought Hurst played well.

Customer

Oh yes ... yes ... he was the only one who did though.

Tape Recorder

Can you put your head down a little, sir?

Customer

Sorry, sorry.

Customer

his head is bowed

Tape Recorder

I prefer to watch Palace nowadays.

Tape Recorder

electric razor starts up again

Tape Recorder

Oh! Sorry! Was that your ear?

Customer

No no ... I didn't feel a thing.

The customer rises out from his seat, taking the sheet off himself and looking in the mirror and delving into pocket. He turns round for the first time and sees the cowering barber.

Customer

Look, what's going on?

Tape Recorder

Yes, it's a nice spot, isn't it.

Customer

Look, I came here for a haircut!

Barber

pathetically

Barber

It looks very nice sir.

Customer

angrily

Customer

It's exactly the same as when I first came in.

Tape Recorder

Right, that's the lot then.

Barber

All right ... I confess I haven't cut your hair ... I hate cutting hair. I have this terrible un-un-uncontrollable fear whenever I see hair. When I was a kid I used to hate the sight of hair being cut. My mother said I was a fool. She said the only way to cure it was to become a barber. So I spent five ghastly years at the Hairdressers' Training Centre at Totnes. Can you imagine what it's like cutting the

Barber

Barber

he is gradually straightening up with a visionary gleam in his eyes

Barber

he tears off his barber's jacket, to reveal tartan shirt and lumberjack trousers underneath; as he speaks the lights dim behind him and a choir of Mounties is heard, faintly in the distance

Barber

moves to stand infront of back-drop of Canadian mountains and forests

Barber

a frail adoring blonde, the heroine of many a mountains film, or perhaps the rebel maid, rushes to his side and looks adoringly into his eyes

Barber

We'd sing ... sing ... sing.

The choir is loud by now and music as well.

Barber

Barber

I sleep all night and I work all day

Light comes up to his left to reveal a choir of Mounties.

Mounties Choir

He's a lumberjack, and he's OK,

Mounties Choir

He sleeps all night and he works all day.

Barber

I cut down trees, I eat my lunch,

Barber

I go to the lavatory.

During the last verse the choir has started to look uncomfortable but they brighten up as they go into the chorus.

Barber

I chop down trees, I wear high heels,

Barber

Suspenders and a bra.

Barber

I wish I'd been a girlie

Barber

Just like my dear Mama.

Mounties Choir

He cuts down trees, he wears high heels

Mounties Choir

Mounties Choir

Suspenders and a .... a Bra????

They all mumble. Music runs down. The girl looks horrified and bursts into tears.

Barber

Girl

Oh Bevis! And I thought you were so rugged.

Cut to hand-written letter.

Voice Over

Dear Sir, I wish to complain in the strongest possible terms about the song which you have just broadcast, about the lumberjack who wears women's clothes. Many of my best friends are lumberjacks and only a few of them are transvestites. Yours faithfully, Brigadier Sir Charles Arthur Strong (Mrs.) PS I have never kissed the editor of the Radio Times.

Compère

Never mind, it's not all it's cracked up to be. Ladies and gentlemen, we give you Ken Buddha and his inflatable knees.

Cut to Ken (Terry J) in evening dress; his knees go 'bang'.

Compère

Ken Buddha, a smile, two bangs and a religion. Now ladies and gentlemen, for your further entertainment, Brian Islam and Brucie.

Two animated men dance to jug band music. When they finish we cut back to the barber and customer.

Barber

So anyway, I became a barber.

Customer

sympathetically

Customer

Poor chap.

Barber

Yes, pity really, I always preferred the outdoor life. Hunting, shooting, fishing. Getting out there with a gun, slaughtering a few of God's creatures - that was the life. Charging about the moorland, blasting their heads off.

Cut to a large country house. A number of sportin' gentlemen dressed in huntin' tweed and carrying shotguns come out, casually firing the guns at random. They climb into a land-rover and drive off. Cut to huntin' country. A line of beater moves towards the camera; as they do so several young couples leap up out of the undergrowth and run away. Shots of hunters stalking their prey and shooting. One of them breaks his gun into two pieces. Another fires into the air. An egg lands on his head. Cut to two duellists (with pistols) and a referee standing between them. They fire; the referee falls dead. A huntin' gentleman fires into the air, falls over backwards; a young couple gets up from close behind him and run away. Another huntin' gentleman is arguing defensively with a pilot who has just landen by parachute. A hunter fires into some bushes; a Red Indian pops up and runs away in alarm. They all return to the house, legs and arms variously in plaster and bandaged. Two of them carry a pole between them from which is slung a very small bird. The picture of the outside of the house freezes and we pull back to reveal that it is a photo on a stand, by which stands the knight in armour, expectantly flexing his raw chicken. The floor manager comes up to him.

Floor Manager

I'm sorry, we don't need you this week.

Knight looks dejected, droops and slinks off, still holding chicken. He walks past a hen house from wherein we hear a voice.

Voice

And now for something completely different.

Cut to a sitting room. Low sexy lighting - ha ha - soft sexy music. On the sofa are Victor and Iris just beginning to make passes at each other.

Victor

Would you mind terribly if I hold your hand?

Iris

Oh no, no, not at all.

Victor

Oh Iris, you're so very beautiful.

Iris

Oh, do you really mean that?

Victor

I do, I do, I do. I think... I'm beginning to fall in love with you.

Iris

Oh Victor.

Victor

It's silly isn't it?

Iris

No, no, not at all dear sweet Victor.

Victor

No I didn't mean that. Only just us being so close together for so many months in the soft-toy department and yet never daring to...

Iris

Oh, oh Victor.

Victor

Oh Iris.

Victor

they move closer to kiss; just before their lips meet the doorbell rings

Victor

Who can that be?

Iris

Oh, well you try and get rid of them.

Victor

Yes I will, I will.

Victor opens the front door. Arthur Name is standing outside the door.

Arthur

Hello!

Victor

Hello.

Arthur

Remember me?

Victor

No I'm...

Arthur

In the pub. The tall thin one with the moustache, remember? About three years ago?

Victor

No, I don't I'm afraid.

Arthur

Oh, blimey, it's dark in here,

Arthur

switches light on

Arthur

that's better. Only you said we must have a drink together sometime, so I thought I'd take you up on it as the film society meeting was cancelled this evening.

Victor

Look, to be frank, it is a little awkward this evening.

Arthur

stepping in; to Iris

Arthur

Hello, I'm Arthur. Arthur Name. Name by name but not by nature. I always say that, don't I Vicky boy?

Victor

Really...

Arthur

to Victor

Arthur

Is that your wife?

Victor

Er, no, actually.

Arthur

Oh, I get the picture. Eh? Well don't worry about me Vicky boy, I know all about one-night stands.

Victor

I beg your pardon?

Arthur

Mind if I change the record?

Arthur

takes the record off

Victor

Look, look, we put that on.

Arthur

Here's a good one, I heard it in a pub. What's brown, what's brown and sounds like a bell?

Arthur

What's brown and sounds like a bell? Dung! Ha, ha, ha, that's a good one. I like that one, I won't keep you long.

Arthur

the gramophone plays the 'Liberty Bell March' very loud

Arthur

That's better, now don't worry about me. I'll wait here till you've finished.

The doorbell rings again.

Victor

Who the hell...

Arthur

I'll get it. It'll be friends of mine. I took the liberty of inviting them along.

Victor

Look, we were hoping to have a quiet evening on our own.

Arthur

Oh, they won't mind. They're very broad-minded. Hello!

He opens the door; Mr and Mrs Equator walk in and go straight up to Victor.

Mr Equator

Good evening. My name is Equator, Mr Equator Equator. Like round the middle of the Earth, only with an L.

Mr Equator

wheezing laugh

Mr Equator

This is my wife Audrey, she smells a bit but she has a heart of gold.

Audrey

Hello, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha...

Victor

There must have been some kind of misunderstanding, because this is not the...

Mr Equator

Who's that then?

Victor

What?

Mr Equator

Who's the bird?

Victor

I'm...

Mr Equator

You got a nice pair there haven't you love.

Mr Equator

puts hand on Iris's boobs and gives a wet kiss; Iris screams

Mr Equator

Shut up you silly bitch, it was only a bit of fun.

Victor

Now look here ...

Mr Equator

Big gin please.

Arthur

I'll get it.

Victor

going after Arthur

Victor

Look, leave those drinks alone.

Audrey

And three tins of beans for me please.

Mr Equator

I told you to lay off the beans, you whore!

Audrey

I only want three cans.

Mr Equator

Button your lip you rat-bag.

Mr Equator

laughs uproariously

Audrey

joins in

Audrey

Ha, ha, ha, ha...

Mr Equator

It was rather witty, wasn't it? Where's my gin?

The doorbell rings again

Victor

Who the hell's that?

Mr Equator

Oh, I took the liberty of inviting an old friend along, as his wife has just passed away, and he's somewhat distraught poor chap. I hope you don't mind.

Arthur

opening door

Arthur

Come on in.

In walks Mr Freight in underpants, sequins, eye make-up, white wellies, and necklace.

Mr Freight

Oh? My God, what a simply ghastly place.

Mr Equator

Not too good is it? A pint of crème de menthe for my friend. Well how are you, you great poof?

Mr Equator

sits down

Mr Equator

throws it into fire

Iris

Aaaagh! Boo boo hooo.

Mr Freight

I've asked along a simply gorgeous little man I picked up outside the Odeon.

Mr Equator

Is he sexy?

In walks Mr Cook with a goat. Freight kisses him.

Mr Cook

I had to bring the goat, he's not well. I only hope he don't go on the carpet.

Mr Equator

to Iris

Mr Equator

Come on then love, drop 'em.

Iris

Aaaaaaagh!

Iris

runs out

Mr Equator

Blimey, she don't go much do she.

He sits in chair which collapses.

Audrey

Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, oooooh! I've wet 'em

Mr Cook

The goat's just done a bundle.

A group of singers run on, dressed as Welsh miners. All talk at once.

Victor

Look, get out all of you. Go on. Get out! Get out!

Mr Equator

I beg your pardon?

Victor

I'm turning you all out. I'm not having my house filled with filthy perverts, now look, I'm giving you just half a minute then I'm going to call the police, so get out.

Mr Equator

I don't much like the tone of your voice.

Oh, what is it dear?

It's from the BBC. They want to know if I want to be in a sketch on telly.

Wife

Oooh. That's nice.

Man

What? It's acting innit?

Wife

Yes.

Man

Well I'm a plumber. I can't act.

Wife

Oh, you never know till you try. Look at Mrs Brando's son next door. He was mending the fridge when they came and asked him to be the Wild One. What do they want you to do?

Man

Well, they just want me to stand at a counter, and when the sketch starts I go out.

Wife

Oh, that sounds nice. It's what they call a walk-on.

Wife

Oh well, you'd better be off then.

Man

Yeah, well, what about the cat?

Wife

Oh I'll look after the cat. Goodness me, Mrs Newman's eldest never worried about the cat when he went off to do 'The Sweet Bird of Youth'.

Man

Wife

Bye bye, and mind you don't get seduced.

Man leaves, wife stands for a moment, then...

Oh, it'll make a change from plumbing. Dad! Frank's got a television part.

She turns on the TV set. On the TV comes the picture of the assistant and the robber and floor manager waiting in the lingerie shop. After a second or two a man is brought in and introduced to floor manager, who positions him and cues him. The man walks out.

Ah Mr Anchovy. Do sit down.

Anchovy

Thank you. Take the weight off the feet, eh?

Counsellor

Yes, yes.

Anchovy

Lovely weather for the time of year, I must say.

Counsellor

Enough of this gay banter. And now Mr Anchovy, you asked us to advise you which job in life you were best suited for.

Anchovy

That is correct, yes.

Counsellor

Well I now have the results here of the interviews and the aptitude tests that you took last week, and from them we've built up a pretty clear picture of the sort of person that you are. And I think I can say, without fear of contradiction, that the ideal job for you is chartered accountancy.

Anchovy

But I

Anchovy

am

Anchovy

a chartered accountant.

Counsellor

Jolly good. Well back to the office with you then.

Anchovy

No! No! No! You don't understand. I've been a chartered accountant for the last twenty years. I want a new job. Something

Well chartered accountancy is rather exciting isn't it?

Anchovy

Exciting? No it's

not

Anchovy

Dull

Anchovy

. My God it's dull, it's so desperately dull and tedious and stuffy and boring and des-per-ate-ly DULL.

Counsellor

Well, er, yes Mr Anchovy, but you see your report here says that you are an extremely dull person. You see, our experts describe you as an appallingly dull fellow, unimaginative, timid, lacking in initiative, spineless, easily dominated, no sense of humour, tedious company and irrepressibly drab and awful. And whereas in most professions these would be considerable drawbacks, in chartered accountancy they are a positive boon.

Anchovy

But don't you see, I came here to find a new job, a new life, a new

Anchovy

meaning

Anchovy

to my existence. Can't you help me?

Counsellor

Well, do you have any idea of what you want to do?

Anchovy

Yes, yes I have.

Counsellor

What?

Anchovy

boldly

Anchovy

Lion taming.

Counsellor

Well yes. Yes. Of course, it's a bit of a jump isn't it? I mean, er, chartered accountancy to lion taming in one go. You don't think it might be better if you worked your way

Counsellor

towards

Counsellor

lion taming, say, via banking?

Anchovy

No, no, no, no. No. I don't want to wait. At nine o'clock tomorrow I want to be in there, taming.

Counsellor

Fine, fine. But do you, do you have any qualifications?

Anchovy

Yes, I've got a hat.

Counsellor

A hat?

Anchovy

Yes, a hat. A lion taming hat. A hat with 'lion tamer' on it. I got it at Harrods. And it lights up saying 'lion tamer' in great big neon letters, so that you can tame them after dark when they're less stroppy.

Counsellor

I see, I see.

Anchovy

And you can switch it off during the day time, and claim reasonable wear and tear as allowable professional expenses under paragraph 335C...

Counsellor

Yes, yes, yes, I do follow, Mr Anchovy, but you see the snag is... if I now call Mr Chipperfield and say to him, 'look here, I've got a forty-five-year-old chartered accountant with me who wants to become a lion tamer', his first question is not going to be 'does he have his own hat?' He's going to ask what sort of experience you've had with lions.

Anchovy

Well I ... I've seen them at the zoo.

Counsellor

Good, good, good.

Anchovy

Lively brown furry things with short stumpy legs and great long noses. I don't know what all the fuss is about, I could tame one of those. They look pretty tame to start with.

Counsellor

And these, er, these lions ... how high are they?

Anchovy

indicating a height of one foot

Anchovy

Well they're about so high, you know. They don't frighten me at all.

Counsellor

Really. And do these lions eat ants?

Anchovy

Yes, that's right.

Counsellor

Er, well, Mr Anchovy ... I'm afraid what you've got hold of there is an anteater.

Anchovy

A what?

Counsellor

An anteater. Not a lion. You see a lion is a huge savage beast, about five feet high, ten feet long, weighing about four hundred pounds, running forty miles per hour, with masses of sharp pointed teeth and nasty long razor-sharp claws that can rip your belly open before you can say 'Eric Robinson', and they look like this.

The counsellor produces large picture of a lion and shows to Mr Anchovy who screams and passes out.

Counsellor

Time enough I think for a piece of wood.

CAPTION: 'THE LARCH'

Picture of a tree.

Voice Over

The larch.

Cut back to office: Mr Anchovy sits up with a start.

Counsellor

Now, shall I call Mr Chipperfield?

Anchovy

Er, no, no, no. I think your idea of making the transition to lion taming via easy stages, say via insurance...

Counsellor

Or banking.

Anchovy

Or banking, yes, yes, banking that's a man's life, isn't it? Banking, travel, excitement, adventure, thrills, decisions affecting people's lives.

Counsellor

Jolly good, well, er, shall I put you in touch with a bank?

Anchovy

Yes.

Counsellor

Fine.

Anchovy

Er... no, no, no. Look, er, it's a big decision, I'd like a couple of weeks to think about it... er... you know, don't want to jump into it too quickly. Maybe three weeks. I could let you know definitely then, I just don't want to make this definite decision. I'm er...

Anchovy

continues muttering nervously to himsel

Counsellor

turning to camera

Counsellor

Well this is just one of the all too many cases on our books of chartered accountancy. The only way that we can fight this terrible debilitating social disease, is by informing the general public of its consequences, by showing young people that it's just not worth it. So, so please... give generously... to this address: The League for Fighting Chartered Accountancy, 55 Lincoln House, Basil Street, London, SW3.

Cut to the sea. Pan to show Ron Obvious running along beach.

Voice Over

There is an epic quality about the sea which has throughout history stirred the hearts and minds of Englishmen of all nations. Sir Francis Drake, Captain Webb, Nelson of Trafalgar and Scott of the Antartic - all rose to the challenge of the mighty ocean. And today another Englishman may add his name to the golden roll of history: Mr Ron Obvious of Neaps End. For today, Ron Obvious hopes to be the first man to jump the Channel.

Ron runs up to group of cheering supporters. An interviewer addresses him.

Interviewer

Ron, now let's just get this quite clear - you're intending to jump across the English Channel?

Ron

Oh yes, that is correct, yes.

Interviewer

And, er, just how far is that?

Ron

Oh, well it's twenty-six miles from here to Calais.

Interviewer

Er, that's to the beach at Calais?

Ron

Well, no, no, provided I get a good lift off and maybe a gust of breeze over the French coast, I shall be jumping into the centre of Calais itself.

Brief shot of group of Frenchmen with banner. 'Fin de Cross-Channel jump'.

Interviewer

Ron are you using any special techniques to jump this great distance?

Ron

Oh no, no. I shall be using an ordinary two-footed jump, er, straight up in the air and across the Channel.

Interviewer

I see. Er, Ron, what is the furthest distance that you've jumped, er, so far?

Ron

Er, oh, eleven foot six inches at Motspur Park on July 22nd. Er, but I have done nearly twelve feet unofficially.

Ron breaks off to make training-type movements.

Interviewer

I see. Er, Ron, Ron, Ron, aren't you worried Ron, aren't you worried jumping twenty-six miles across the sea?

Ron

Oh, well no, no, no, no. It is in fact easier to jump over sea than over dry land.

Interviewer

Well how is that?

Ron

Er, well my manager explained it to me. You see if you're five miles out over the English Channel, with nothing but sea underneath you, er, there is a very great impetus to say in the air.

Interviewer

I see. Well, er, thank you very much Ron and the very best of luck.

Ron

Thank you. Thank you.

Interviewer

Interviewer

turns to speak to Vercotti, who has a Mafia suit and dark glasses

Interviewer

Mr Vercotti, er Mr Vercotti ... Mr Vercotti...

Mr Vercotti

Mr Vercotti

I don't know what you're talking about.

Interviewer

Er, no, we're from the BBC, Mr Vercotti.

Mr Vercotti

Who?

Interviewer

Mr Vercotti

Oh, oh. I see. I thought, I thought you were the er . .. I like the police a lot, I've got a lot of time for them.

Interviewer

Mr, er, Mr Vercotti, what is your chief task as Ron's manager?

Mr Vercotti

Well my main task is, er, to fix a sponsor for the big jump.

Interviewer

And who is the sponsor?

Mr Vercotti

The Chippenham Brick Company. Ah, they, er, pay all the bills, er, in return for which Ron will be carrying half a hundredweight of their bricks.

We see a passport officer checking Ron's passport.

Interviewer

I see. Well, er, it looks as if Ron is ready now. He's got the bricks. He's had his passport checked and he's all set to go. And he's off on the first ever cross-Channel jump.

Interviewer

Ron runs down the beach and jumps; he lands about four feet into the water

Interviewer

Will Ron be trying the cross-Channel jump again soon?

Mr Vercotti

No. No. I'm taking him off the jumps. Er, because I've got something lined up for Ron next week that I think is very much more up his street.

Interviewer

Er, what's that?

Mr Vercotti

Er, Ron is going to eat Chichester Cathedral.

Cut to Chichester Cathedral. Ron walks up to it, brushing his teeth.

Interviewer

Well, there he goes, Ron Obvious of Neaps End, in an attempt which could make him the first man ever to eat an entire Anglican Cathedral.

Ron takes a hefty bite at a buttress, screams and clutches his mouth. Cut to countryside: a map, and a banner saying 'Tunnelling to Java'. Interviewer and Vercotti walk up to map.

Mr Vercotti

Well, er, I think, David, this is something which Ron and myself are really keen on. Ron is going to tunnel from Godalming here to Java here.

Mr Vercotti

indicates inaccurately on map

Interviewer

Java.

Mr Vercotti

Yeah, er, I, I personally think this is going to make Ron a household name overnight.

Interviewer

And how far has he got?

Mr Vercotti

Er, well, he's quite far now, Dave, well on the way. Well on the way, yeah.

Interviewer

Well where is he exactly?

Mr Vercotti

Yeah.

Interviewer

Where?

Mr Vercotti

Oh, er, well, er, you know, it's difficult to say exactly. He's er, you know, in the area of er, Ron, how far have you got?

Ron

Ron

Oh about two foot six Mr Vercotti.

Mr Vercotti

Yeah well keep digging lad, keep digging.

Ron

Mr Vercotti are you sure there isn't a spade?

Cut to interviewer and Vercotti by railway track.

Interviewer

Er, Mr Verccotti, what do you say to people who accuse you of exploiting Ron for your own purposes?

Mr Vercotti

Well, it's totally untrue, David. Ever since I left Sicily I've been trying to do the best for Ron. I know what Ron wants to do, I believe in him and I'm just trying to create the opportunities for Ron to do the kind of things he wants to do.

Interviewer

And what's he going to do today?

Mr Vercotti

He's going to split a railway carriage with his nose.

Mr Vercotti

screams off

Cut to a hillside; Vercotti, interviewer, and in the background a banner: 'Running to Mercury'.

Mr Vercotti

The only difficult bit for Ron is getting out of the Earth's atmosphere. Er, once he's in orbit he'll be able to run straight to Mercury.

A heavily bandaged Ron leaps off starting platform: freeze frame. Scream. Cut to a tombstone: 'Ron Obvious 1941-1969 - very talented', Pull back to show Vercotti.

Mr Vercotti

I am now extremely hopeful that Ron will break the world record for remaining underground. He's a wonderful boy this, he's got this really enormous talent, this really huge talent.

Over the last shot of graveyard and wind whistling, we hear two ladies' voices.

Man

No, that's the terrier.

Shopkeeper

Well, it's as near as dammit.

Man

Well what do you mean? I want a cat.

Shopkeeper

Listen, tell you what. I'll file its legs down a bit, take its snout out, stick a few wires through its cheeks. There you are, a lovely pussy cat.

Man

Its not a proper cat.

Shopkeeper

What do you mean?

Man

Well it wouldn't meow.

Shopkeeper

Well it would howl a bit.

Man

No, no, no, no. Er, have you got a parrot?

Shopkeeper

No, I'm afraid not actually guv, we're fresh out of parrots. I'll tell you what though ... I'll lop its back legs off, make good, strip the fur, stick a couple of wings on and staple on a beak of your own choice.

Shopkeeper

taking small box and rattling it

Shopkeeper

No problem. Lovely parrot.

Man

How long would that take?

No I need it for tomorrow. It's a present.

Shopkeeper

Oh dear, it's a long job. You see parrot conversion ... Tell you what though, for free, terriers make lovely fish. I mean I could do that for you straight away. Legs off, fins on, stick a little pipe through the back of its neck so it can breathe, bit of gold paint, make good ...

Man

You'd need a very big tank.

Shopkeeper

It's a great conversation piece.

Yes, all right, all right ... but, uh, only if I can watch.

Ssh! Next!

Chairman

a gorilla enters

Chairman

Good morning - Mr Phipps?

Gorilla

That's right, yes.

Chairman

Er, do take a seat.

Gorilla

Right sir.

Gorilla

sits

Chairman

Now could you tell us roughly why you want to become a librarian?

Gorilla

Er, well, I've had a certain amount of experience running a library at school.

Chairman

Yes, yes. What sort of experience?

Gorilla

Er, well for a time I ran the Upper Science Library.

Chairman

Yes, yes. Now Mr Phipps, you do realize that the post of librarian carries with it certain very important responsibilities. I mean, there's the selection of books, the record library, and the art gallery. Now it seems to me that your greatest disadvantage is your lack of professional experience ... coupled with the fact that, uh, being a gorilla, you would tend to frighten people.

Vicar

aside

Vicar

Is he a gorilla?

Chairman

Yes he is.

Vicar

Well why didn't it say on his form that he's a gorilla?

Chairman

Well, you see applicants are not required to fill in their species.

Vicar

What was that picture?

Chairman

Sh! ... Mr Phipps, what is your attitude toward censorship in a public library?

Gorilla

How do you mean, sir?

Vicar

Well I mean for instance, would you for instance stock 'Last Exit to Brooklyn'... or ... 'Groupie'?

Gorilla

Yes, I think so.

Vicar

Good.

Chairman

Yes, well, that seems to me to be very sensible Mr Phipps. I can't pretend that this library hasn't had its difficulties ... Mr Robertson, your predecessor, an excellent librarian, savaged three people last week and had to be destroyed.

Gorilla

I'm sorry sir.

Chairman

Oh, no, don't be sorry. You see, I don't believe that libraries should be drab places where people sit in silence, and that's been the main reason for our policy of employing wild animals as librarians.

Vicar

And also, they're much more permissive. Pumas keep Hank Janson on open shelves...

Chairman

Yes. Yes. Yes.

Chairman

a maniacal look in his eyes

Chairman

collects himself

Chairman

Mr Phipps ... Kong! You can be our next librarian - you're proud, majestic and fierce enough ... will you do it?

Gorilla

I ... don't think I can sir.

Vicar

Why not?

Gorilla

I.. I'm not really a gorilla.

Vicar

Eh?

Gorilla

I'm a librarian in a skin.

Chairman

Why this deception?

Gorilla

Well, they said it was the best way to get the job.

Chairman

Get out, Mr Librarian Phipps, seeing as you're not a gorilla, but only dressed up as one, trying to deceive us in order to further your career ...

He kisses her on the forehead. She wakes.

Vera ... Vera ... darling! Wake up my little lemon. Come to my arms.

Vera

Maurice! What are you doing here?

I could not keep away from you. I must have you all the time.

Vera

Oh this is most inconvenient.

Maurice

Don't talk to me about convenience, love consumes my naughty mind, I'm delirious with desire.

He kisses her hand repeatedly. The husband wakes up with a start, sits bolt upright and looks straight ahead.

Husband

What's that, Vera?

Vera

Oh, er, nothing dear. It's just the toilet filling up.

Husband

he goes fast asleep again

By this stage all the men have pulled up chairs in a circle around Vera's side of the bed. They are all chatting amongst themselves. Biggles is holding her hand. Maurice has produced a bottle of vin ordinaire. At this moment four Mexican musicans appear on the husband's side of the bed. The leader of the band nudges the husband, who wakes.

Mexican

Scusey... you tell me where is ... Mrs Vera Jackson ... please.

Husband

Yes ... right and right again.

Mexican

Muchas gracias...

He immediately goes back to sleep again. The Mexicans all troop round the bed and enter the group. The leader conducts them and they start up a little conga . . . once they've started he turns and comes over to Vera with a naughty glint in his eye. They play a guitar, a trumpet and maracas.

Mexican

Oh Vera ... you remember Acapulco in the Springtime ...

Vera

Oh. The Herman Rodrigues Four!

Suddenly the husband wakes up.

Husband

Vera!

Husband

there is immediate silence

Husband

I distinctly heard a Mexican rhythm combo.

Vera

Oh no, dear... it was just the electric blanket switching off.

Husband

Hm. Well I'm going for a tinkle.

He gets out of bed and disappears into the gloom.

Oh no you can't do that. Here, we haven't finished the sketch yet!

We're interrupting this sketch but we'll be bringing you back the moment anything interesting happens. Meanwhile here are some friends of mine.

Letter and voice over.

Voice Over

Dear Sir, I'm sorry this letter is late, it should have come at the beginning of the programme. Yours, Ivor Bigbottie, (age two).

Two chairs in interview set. Smart interviewer and footballer (who is not over bright) in blazer.

Interviewer

From the plastic arts we turn to football. Last night in the Stadium of Light, Jarrow, we witnessed the resuscitation of a great footballing tradition, when Jarrow United came of age, in a European sense, with an almost Proustian display of modern existentialist football. Virtually annihilating by midfield moral argument the now surely obsolescent catennachio defensive philosophy of Signor Alberto Fanffino. Bologna indeed were a side intellectually out argued by a Jarrow team thrusting and bursting with aggressive Kantian positivism and outstanding in this fine Jarrow team was my man of the match, the arch-thinker, free scheming, scarcely ever to be curbed, midfield cognoscento, Jimmy Buzzard.

Buzzard

Good evening Brian.

Interviewer

Jimmy, at least one ageing football commentator was gladdened last night by the sight of an English footballer breaking free of the limpid tentacles of packed Mediterranean defence.

Interviewer

Were you surprised at the way the Italians ceded midfield dominance so early on in the game?

Buzzard

Well Brian... I'm opening a boutique.

Interviewer

This is of course symptomatic of a new breed of footballer as it is indeed symptomatic of your whole genre of player, is it not?

Interviewer

What I'm getting at, Jimmy, is you seem to have discovered a new concept with a mode in which you dissected the Italian defence, last night.

Buzzard

pauses for thought

Buzzard

smiles and looks around

Interviewer

Do you think Jarrow will adopt a more defensive posture for the first leg of the next tie in Turkey?

Buzzard

confidently

Buzzard

I hit the ball first time and there it was in the back of the net.

Interviewer

Yes, yes - but have you any plans for dealing with the free-scoring Turkish forwards?

Cut to undertaker.

Second Undertaker

And now let's take a look at the state of play in the detective sketch.

Cut to drawing room. There is an enormous pile of dead policemen from the Agatha Christie Sketch on and around the sofa.

Constable

Alself me to introlow mybody...

Inspector shoots him in the head.

CAPTION: 'CONSTABLES 13 SUPERINTENDENTS 9'

Cut to four undertakers carrying a coffin up a hill. One of them falters and drops. The others lower the coffin to the ground, take out a fresh undertaker, put the fallen one in the coffin, and proceed.

Cut to animated sequence, leadning to big glittering flashing lights saying 'Interesting People'. A compère sits at desk, with guest chairs beside it.

Compère

Hello, good evening, and welcome to yet another edition of 'Interesting People'. And my first interesting person tonight is the highly interesting Mr Howard Stools from Kendal in Westmorland.

He puts a matchbox on desk in front of him. He presses a button on the desk and we hear applause. Releases button; applause stops abruptly. He opens the box a little and speaks into it.

Compère

Good evening Mr Stools.

Voice

Hello, David.

Compère

Mr Stools, what makes you particularly interesting?

Voice

Well, I'm only half an inch long.

Compère

Well that's

Mr Stools

I thought you'd think that was interesting David, in fact...

Our next guest tonight has come all the way from Egypt, he's just flown into London today, he's Mr Ali Bayan, he's with us in the studio tonight and he's stark raving mad.

Applause. Cut to Ali Bayan who looks at camera in a very mad way. Applause.

Compère

Mr Ali Bayan, stark raving mad. Now it's time for our music spot and we turn the spotlight tonight on the Rachel Toovey Bicycle Choir,

Compère

with their fantastic arrangement of 'Men of Harlech' for bicycle bells only.

Cut to six men in oilskins and sou'westers. They sing 'Men of Harlech ', and at the end of each line mournfully ring bells. Applause at end.

Compère

The Rachel Toovey Bicycle Choir. Really interesting. Remember, if you're interesting and want to appear on this programme, write your name and address and your telephone number and send it to this address:

Thank you, thank you. Now here's an interesting person. Apart from being a full-time stapling machine, he can also give a cat influenza.

Cut to a smart dressed man who coughs into a cat basket. We hear a meow and a feline sneeze. Cut back to compère.

Compère

Well, you can't get much more interesting than that, or can you? With me now is Mr Thomas Walters of West Hartlepool who is totally invisible. Good evening, Mr Walters.

Compère

Walters

Walters

Over here, Hughie.

Compère turns to find a boringly dressed man sitting by him.

Compère

Mr Walters, are you sure you're invisible?

Walters

Oh yes, most certainly.

Compère

Well, Mr Walters, what's it like being invisible?

Walters

slowly and boringly

Walters

Well, for a start, at the office where I work I can be sitting at my desk all day and the others totally ignore me. At home, even though we are in the same room, my wife does not speak to me for hours, people pass me by in the street without a glance in my direction, and I can walk into a room without...

Compère

Well, whilst we've got interesting people, we met Mr Oliver Cavendish who...

Walters

droning on

Walters

... Even now you yourself, you do hardly notice me...

Compère

Mr Oliver Cavendish of Leicester, who claims to be able to recite the entire Bible in one second, whilst being struck on the head with a large axe. Ha, ha, wow. We've since discovered that he was a fraud, yes a fraud, he did not in fact recite the entire Bible he merely recited the first two words, 'In the...' before his death.

Cut to film montage of sporting clips.

Compère

Compère

Now it's time for 'Interesting Sport', and this week it's all-in cricket, live from the Municipal Baths, Croydon.

Boxing ring; two fully kitted out cricketers, who as the bell goes, approach each other and start hitting each other with cricket bats. Applause.

Compère

With me now is Mr Ken Dove, twice voted the most interesting man in Dorking. Ken, I believe you're interested in shouting.

Dove

shouting

Dove

Yes, I'm interested in shouting all right, by jove you certainly hit the nail on the head with that particular observation of yours then.

Compère

What does your wife think of this?

Wife

voice off, full-blooded

Wife

I agree with him.

Dove

Shut up!

Walters

Man holding cat enters.

Compère

That is Tiddles, I believe?

Man

Yes, this is, this is Tiddles.

Compère

Yes, and what does she do?

Man

She flies across the studio and lands in a bucket of water.

Compère

By herself?

Man

No, I fling her.

Compère

Well that's extremely interesting, Ladies and gentlemen - Mr Don Savage and Tiddles.

Man whirls the cat round and round. He lets go of the cat, it flies across studio. A hollow splash and a meow. Quick shot of a real cat sitting in a bucket.

Dove

I'm more interesting than a wet pussycat.

Walters

... for hour after hour...

Walters

we see only his empty chair

Compère

Yes, great, well now for the first lime on television 'Interesting People' brings you a man who claims he can send bricks to sleep by hypnosis. Mr Keith Maniac from Guatemala.

Maniac is sitting by compère. He wears a top hat and an opera cloak.

Maniac

Good evening.

Compère

Keith, you claim you can send bricks to sleep.

Maniac

Yes, that is correct, I can...

Compère

Entirely by hypnosis.

Maniac

Yes ... I use no artificial means, whatsoever.

Maniac

leans and picks matchbox off desk to light pipe, opens it and strikes match

Voice

Voice

Aaagh!

Dove

You've injured Mr Stools!

Maniac

picks up other box and lights pipe

Maniac

I simply stare at the brick and it goes to sleep.

Compère

Well, we have a brick here, Keith.

Compère

indicates brick on desk

Compère

Perhaps you can send it to sleep for us...

Maniac

Oh ... Ah, well, I am afraid that is already asleep.

Compère

How do you know?

Maniac

Well, it's not moving ....

Compère

Oh, I see - have we got a moving brick? Yes, we've got a moving brick, Keith, it's coming over now.

We see a man in a white coat preparing to throw brick. He throws it gently. It lands on the desk in front of Keith. Keith stares at it as it falls.

Maniac

There we are, fast asleep.

Compère

Very good, very good indeed.

Maniac

All done with the eyes.

Compère

Yes, Mr Keith Maniac from Guatemala.

Dove

distressed - to matchbox

Dove

Mr Stools - speak to me, Howard.

Quick cut back to all-in cricket.

Compère

Mr Keith Maniac of Guatemala... and now four tired undertakers.

Cut to film of four undertakers struggling up a hill carrying a coffin. One staggers and drops. The others lower the coffin, pick him up, and place him inside. Raising the coffin again they stagger off up the hill. Another undertaker collapses; the remaining two place him in the coffin. Exhaustedly they pick up the coffin, but have only gone two or three paces when one of them collapses. The remaining one drags him into the coffin, pushing him in with some difficulty, and forces the lid shut. He debates with himself for a moment on how to pick up the coffin, then disgustedly throws away his hat and climbs into the coffin, shutting the lid behind him. The coffin moves off by itself.

Voice Over

We interrupt this very quickly to take you back to the Jimmy Buzzard interview, where we understand something exciting's just happened.

Cut back to the interview studio; Jimmy Buzzard is sitting on the floor.

Buzzard

I've fallen off my chair, Brian.

Cut to a graveyard. The coffin, still moving of its own volition, enters the graveyard. A vicar walks up and motions gravediggers

who we cannot see

to get out of the grave. Out of the grave climb two gravediggers. . . then two more... then two more... yet another two... two miners ... two uniformed men... a police dog with handler... and finally an Australian surfboarder. The coffin makes its way into the grave. Then a wonderful piece of animation by the amazing animator Terry Gilliam, wonderboy. Consisting of a very fast collage of extremely sexy stills of half-dressed and naked girls.

Incredibly torchy music, after eight seconds of which:

Cut to fantastically alluring boudoir: a plush four poster bed with silk drapes, silk sheets, a fur pillow etc. We look down on it from above. Stretched out on the bed is a girl (Carol) oozing with sex... a real professional... black net stocking, suspenders, bra and panties or what have you. She moves as if in the throes of orgasm as she mimes to a very masculine voice off.

Good evening. Tonight I want to examine the whole question of eighteenth-century social legislation - its relevance to the hierarchical structure of post-Renaissance society, and its impact on the future of parochial organization in an expanding agrarian economy. But first a bit of fun.

Cut to film of eight-second striptease. Cut immediately back to the same set.

Canning

I beg your pardon?

The stuff of history is indeed woven in the woof. Pearl Harbour. There are pages in history's book which are written on the grand scale. Events so momentous that they dwarf man and time alike. And such is the Battle of Pearl Harbour, re-enacted for us now by the women of Barley Townswomen's Guild.

Cut to a muddy corner of a field. Miss Rita Fairbanks stands talking straight to camera. Behind her lurk five more pepperpots.

Canning

Miss Rita Fairbanks - you organized this reconstruction of the Battle of Pearl Harbour - why?

Rita

Well we've always been extremely interested in modern drama ... we were of course the first Townswomen's Guild to perform 'Camp On Blood Island', and last year we did our extremely popular re-enactment of 'Nazi War Atrocities'. So this year we thought we would like to do something in a lighter vein...

Canning

So you chose the Battle of Pearl Harbour?

Rita

Yes, that's right, we did.

Canning

Well I can see you're all ready to go. So I'll just wish you good luck in your latest venture.

Rita

Thank you very much, young man.

She retreats, and joins the other ladies who meanwhile separate into two opposing sides facing each other.

Two people seated opposite each other at a desk. Between them there is a large window. It appears that they are quite high up in a large office building. Every so often a body falls past the window. They are both working busily.

After a pause a body drops past the window. First Man talks. Second Man hasn't noticed.

First Man

SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'SPECTRUM'

Presenter

Good evening. Tonight 'Spectrum' looks at one of the major problems in the world today - that old vexed question of what is going on. Is there still time to confront it, let alone solve it, or is it too late? What are the figures, what are the facts, what do people mean when they talk about things? Alexander Hardacre of the Economic Affairs Bureau.

Cut to equally intense pundit in front of a graph with three different coloured columns with percentages at the top. He talks with great authority.

Hardacre

In this graph, this column represents 23% of the population. This column represents 28% of the population, and this column represents 43% of the population.

Pull out to reveal bearded professor sitting next to presenter.

Presenter

... Professor, you've spent many years researching into things, what do you think?

Professor

I think it's too early to tell.

Cut to presenter, he talks even faster now.

Presenter

'Too early to tell' ... too early to say... it means the same thing. The word 'say' is the same as the word 'tell'. They're not spelt the same, but they mean the same. It's an identical situation, we have with 'ship' and 'boat'

Presenter

SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'A SMALL BOARDING HOUSE IN MINEHEAD, SOMERSET'

Mr and Mrs Johnson, a typical holidaying bourgeois couple walk up to the front door and ring the bell. Inside the boarding house, the landlady goes up to the front door and opens it.

Landlady

Hello, Mr and Mrs Johnson?

Mr Johnson

That's right. Yes.

Landlady

Well come on in, excuse me not shaking hands, I've just been putting a bit of lard on the cat's boil.

Johnson

Very nice.

Landlady

Well you must be tired, it's a long way from Coventry, isn't it?

Johnson

Well, we usually reckon on five and a half hours and it took us six hours and fifty-three minutes, with the twenty-five minute stop at Frampton Cottrell to stretch our legs, only we had to wait half an hour to get onto the M5 at Droitwich.

Landlady

Really?

Johnson

Then there was a three mile queue just before Bridgewater on the A38. We usually come round on the B3339 just before Bridgewater, you see...

Johnson

Ye, but this time we decided to risk it because they're always saying they're going to widen it there.

Landlady

Are they?

Johnson

Yes well just by the intersection, there where the A372 joins up, there's plenty of room to widen it there, there's only grass verges. They could get another six feet...knock down that hospital... Then we took the coast road through Williton and got all the Taunton traffic on the A358 from Crowcombe and Stogumber...

Landlady

Well you must be dying for a cup of tea.

Johnson

Well, wouldn't say no, not if it's warm and wet.

Landlady

Well come on in the lounge, I'm just going to serve afternoon tea.

Johnson

In the lounge are sitting another bourgeois couple Mr and Mrs Phillips.

Good afternoon.

It's their third time here with us, we can't keep you away can we? Ha, ha, and over here is Mr Hilter.

Landlady leads Mr and Mrs Johnson over to a table at which Adolf Hitler is sitting poring over a map. He is in full Nazi uniform. Himmler and Von Ribbentrop are also sitting at the table with him, Himmler in Nazi uniform and von Ribbentrop in evening dress, with an Iron Cross.

Himmler

How do you do there squire, also I am not Minehead lad but I in Peterborough, Lincolnshire was given birth to, but stay in Peterborough Lincolnshire house all during war, owing to nasty running sores, and was unable to go in the streets play football or go to Nürnberg. I am retired vindow cleaner and pacifist, without doing war crimes

Johnson

What's happens then?

Landlady

Well it's the North Minehead bye-election. Mr Hilter's standing as the National Bocialist candidate. He's got wonderful plans for Minehead.

Johnson

Like what?

Landlady

Well, for a start he wants to annex Poland.

Johnson

Oh, North Minehead's Conservative, isn't it?

Landlady

Well, they get a lot of people at their rallies.

Johnson

Rallies?

Meanwhile back on the balcony.

Hitler

very exited

Hitler

Und Bridgwater ist die letzte Fühlung das wir haben in Somerset!

Over this we hear loud applause and 'Sieg Heils'. The yokel, who is not applauding, turns round rather surprised to see whence cometh the applause. He sees Von Ribbentrop operating a grammophone.

Presenter

Foam at the mouth and fall over backwards. Is he foaming at the mouth to fall over backwards or falling over backwards to foam at the mouth. Tonight 'Spectrum' examines the whole question of frothing and falling, coughing and calling, screaming and bawling, walling and stalling, galling and mauling, palling and hauling, trawling and squalling and zalling. Zalling? Is there a word zalling? If there is what does it mean...if there isn't what does it mean? Perhaps both. Maybe neither. What do I mean by the word mean? What do I mean by the word word, what do I mean by what do I mean, what do I mean by do, and what do I do by mean? What do I do by do by do and what do I do by wasting your time like this? Goodnight.

Second Sergeant

Hello, sarge!

First Sergeant

First Sergeant

Evening Charlie.

The second sergeant is taking his coat off, and the first one begins to pack up his papers. The man carries on with his tale of woe, but still in a high-pitched shriek.

Man

I was sitting at home with a friend of mine from Camber Sands, when we heard a noise in the bedroom. We went to investigate and found £5,000 stolen.

First Sergeant

Well, I'm afraid I'm going off duty now sir. Er, could you tell First Sergeant Foster?

He leaves counter. Sergeant Foster comes forward with a helpful smile.

Second Sergeant

Excuse me sir, but, er, why the funny voice?

Second Sergeant

I'm terribly sorry... I can't hear you, sir, could you try speaking in a lower register?

Man

What! Oh

Man

in a very deep voice

Man

I wish to report the loss of £5,000.

Second Sergeant

£5,000? That's serious, you'd better speak to the detective inspector.

At that moment, via the miracle of cueing, the detective inspector comes out of his office.

Inspector

Inspector

What's the trouble, sergeant?

Second Sergeant

speaking at fantastic speed

Second Sergeant

Well- this- gentleman- sir- has- just- come- in- to- report- that- he- was- sitting- at- home- with- a- friend- when- he- heard- a- noise- in- the- backroom- went- round- to- investigate- and- found- that-£5,000- in- savings- had- been- stolen.

Commentator

Good afternoon and welcome to Hurlingham Park. You join us just as the competitors are running out onto the field on this lovely winter's afternoon here, with the going firm underfoot and very little sign of rain. Well it certainly looks as though we're in for a splendid afternoon's sport in this the 127th Upperclass Twit of the Year Show. Well the competitors will be off in a moment so let me just identify for you.

And so the final result: The Upperclass Twit of the Year - Gervaise Brook-Hampster of Kensington and Weybridge; runner up - Vivian Smith-Smythe-Smith of Kensington; and third - Nigel Incubator-Jones of Henley. Well there'll certainly be some car door slamming in the streets of Kensington tonight.

Cartoon link into still a of beautiful country home. 'Hearts of Oak' -type music. The camera tracks into the house and mixes to: close-up of distinguished, noble father and gay, innocent beautiful daughter - a delicately beautiful English rose.

Father

Now I understand that you want to marry my daughter?

The story so far: Rosamund's father has become ensnared by Mr Shabby's extraordinary personal magnetism. Bob and Janet have eaten Mr Farquar's goldfish during an Oxfam lunch, and Mrs Elsmore's marriage is threatened by Doug's insistence that he is on a different level of consciousness. Louise's hernia has been confirmed, and Jim, Bob's brother, has run over the editor of the 'Lancet' on his way to see Jenny, a freelance Pagoda designer. On the other side of the continent Napoleon still broods over the smouldering remains of a city he had crossed half the earth to conquer...

SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'THE RT. HON. LAMBERT WARBECK'

Minister

Good evening. We in the Wood Party feel very strongly that the present weak drafting of the Local Government Bill leaves a lot to be desired, and we intend to fight.

He thumps on the desk and he falls through the floor. (Yes Mr Director you did read that right: he fell through the floor and added a fortune to the budget). As he falls he emits a long scream, fading away slowly. Another man comes and looks down into the pit.

Man

Hello Helllllllllloooooooooo!

Man

goes and looks at pit

Man

Helloooo.

Minister

unseen, a long way down

Minister

Helloooooo.

Man

Are you all right minister?

Minister

I appear to have landed on this kind of ledge thing.

Man

Shall we lower down one of the BBC ropes?

Minister

If you'd be so kind.

Man

What length of BBC rope will we be likely to need?

Minister

I should use the longest BBC rope. That would be a good idea I would imagine.

Man

Okey doke chief. Er, Tex get the longest BBC rope, and bring it here pronto.

Minister

still a long way down

Minister

man drops the script down and Tex appears with enormous coil of rope

Minister

The script would appear to have landed on a different ledge somewhat out of my grasp, don't you know.

Man

Er, well perhaps when the rope reaches you minister you could kind of swing over to the ledge and grab it.

Minister

Good idea.

Cut to minister swinging on rope.

CAPTION: 'THE RT. HON. LAMBERT WARBECK'

Well I'm going to carry on, if I can read the script.

I think love if we turn the picture upside down we should help the minister, then.

Cut to minister. The picture is now the other way up. The minister now appears to be the right way up.

Minister

Oh good. Look, er, I'm sorry about this, but there seem to be a few gremlins about... I think I'd better start from the beginning. Er, good evening, we in the Wood Party feel very strongly about, oh ...

Minister

Bloody heck. Oh, oh dear, er terribly sorry about this, about saying bloody heck on all channels, but, er...

Meanwhile a man, the right way up, has been lowered down to the minister. As the picture is reversed, he appears to be moving straight up towards him. The minister sees him.

Is this the furthest distance that a minister has fallen? Robert.

Second Robert

Well surprisingly not. The Canadian Minister for External Affairs fell nearly seven miles during a Liberal Conference in Ottawa about six years ago, and then quite recently the Kenyan Minister for Agric. and Fish fell nearly twelve miles during a Nairobi debate in Parliament, although this hasn't been ratified yet.

First Robert

Er, how far did the Filipino cabinet fall last March?

Second Robert

Er, well they fell nearly thirty-nine miles but it's not really so remarkable as that was due to their combined weight, of course. Robert.

First Robert

Thank you, Robert. Well now what's your reaction to all this, Robert?

Cut to third Robert who is staring intently into camera. He is wearing a fright wig and has a left eyebrow four inches above his right one.

Third Robert

Well, well Robert the main thing is that it's terribly exciting. You see the minister is quite clearly lodged between rocks we know terribly little of. Terribly little. Of course the main thing is we're getting colour pictures of an extraordinarily high quality. The important thing is, the really exciting thing is the minister will

Third Robert

as he gets more excited he starts to emit smoke

Oh I don't think it's a proper restaurant unless they give you finger bowls. Oo I don't like him. I'm going to have a baby in a few years.

He

the waiter grimaces

He

I'm sorry about that.

Waiter

That's all right sir, we get all sorts of lines in here. The head waiter will be along to abuse you in a few moments, and now if you'll excuse me I have to go and commit suicide.

He

Oh I'm sorry.

Waiter

It's all right. It's not because of anything serious.

He exits. Shot off-screen and scream.

She

Quite frankly I'm against people who commit suicide, I don't like that sort of person at all. I'm plain people and I'm proud of it, my mother's the salt of the earth, and I don't take the pill 'cos it's nasty.

The head waiter comes in.

He

Please excuse my wife, she may not be very beautiful, and she may have no money, and she may be a little talentless, boring and dull, but on the other hand ...

He

long pause

He

... sorry I can't think of anything.

Head Waiter

Fine. I'm the head waiter. This is a vegetarian restaurant only, we serve no animal flesh of any kind. We're not only proud of that, we're smug about it. So if you were to come in here asking me to rip open a small defenseless chicken, so you could chew its skin and eat its intestines, then I'm afraid I'd have to ask you to leave.

No, no, no, no.

Fine. Would you care for a glass of blood? Oh what a giveaway.

She

No, we'd like to see the menu please. I don't think it's a proper restaurant unless you have a proper menu and anyway I might be pregnant.

He

Perhaps you'd care for a drink?

Ever since you've married me, Douglas, you've treated me like an albatross.

Cardinal Richelieu - sixteen stone of pure man. And now your favourite Roman Emperor Julius Caesar as Eddie Waring.

Cut to Caesar; cloud effects behind.

Caesar

in Waring voice

Caesar

Tota gallia divisa est in tres partes Wigan, Hunslett and Hull Kingston Rovers.

Cut back to Wiggin.

Wiggin

Well done indeed, Julius Caesar, a smile, a conquest and a dagger up your strap. Our next challenger comes all the way from the Crimea. It's the very lovely Florence Nightingale as Brian London.

Florence Nightingale (Graham) stands there with a lamp, simpering femininely. A boxing bell goes, slight pause, then she is hit on the side of the cheek with a boxing glove, and fallls straight on her back.

Wiggin

And now for our most ambitious attempt tonight - all the way from Moscow in the USS of R - Ivan the Terrible as a sales assistant in Freeman, Hardy and Willis.

In a shoe department. Three people are sitting in chain, only the middle one is a dummy. Ivan the Terrible comes in and splits the man in the middle in half with an immense two-handed sword: the model splits in two.

Wiggin

And now W. G. Grace as a music box.

ANIMATION: Still picture of W. G. Grace. Slowly his head starts to revolve as a musical box plays Swiss-type music.

Cut back to Wiggin.

Wiggin

And now it's France's turn. One of their top statesmen, Napoleon as the R101 disaster.

Cut to a sky backgrouned Napoleon comes into frame horizontally, moving along a wire very slowly. In each hand he has a small propeller. A sign hangs below his belly saying R101. Marseillaise plays. As he passes out of shot there is an explosion.

Wiggin

And now it's request time.

Cut to Gumby.

Gumby

I would like to see John the Baptist's impersonation of Graham Hill.

A head on a platter is pulled by a string across the floor. We hear brm, brm, brm, noises. The head of John the Baptist has a Graham Hill moustache, obviously stuck on.

Women's Institute applaud.

Wiggin

And now a short intermission during which Marcel Marceau will impersonate a man walking against the wind.

Marcel Marceau (Graham) walks against the wind.

Wiggin

And now Marcel will mime a man being struck about the head by a sixteen-ton weight.

Cut to him starting the mime. He doesn't get very far as a sixteen-ton weight is dropped on his head.

Cut to Wembley crowd cheering.

Cut to interviewer and two small boys.

Interviewer

Interviewer

What's your name?

Eric

Eric.

Interviewer

Would you like to have a sixteen-ton weight dropped on top of you, Eric?

Eric

Don't know.

Brief stock shot of theatre audience applauding.

Interviewer

How about you?

Michael

I want to have.

Interviewer

What do you want to have?

Michael

I want to have... I want to have Racquel Welch dropped on top of me.

Interviewer

Dropped on top of you.

Michael

Oh yes, not climbing.

Eric

She's got a big bottom.

Applause stock shot. Cut to interviewer and two city gents (on their knees).

Interviewer

And what's your name?

Trevor

Trevor Atkinson.

Interviewer

And how old are you, Trevor?

Trevor

I'm forty-two.

Applause stock shot.

Interviewer

to other city gent

Interviewer

Are you a friend of Trevor's?

City Gent

Yes, we're all colleagues from the Empire and General Insurance Company.

Interviewer

And what do you do?

City Gent

Well I deal mainly with mortgage protection policies, but I also do certain types of life assurance.

Interviewer

Now if you and your pal had one big wish, Trevor, what would you like to see on television?

Trevor

I'd like to see more fairy stories about the police.

Fairy godmother trips lightly into shot.

Fairy

And so you shall.

Cut to open country. A policeman cycles up and parks his bike. From the saddlebag he takes a burglar's outfit - striped jersey, cap, and trousers. He lays them out on the ground, and inflates them with a bicycle pump. The inflated burglar runs away in speeded-up motion. The policeman blows his whistle. Three more policemen appear out of nowhere. He points forward and the four of them move off in a pixilated motion after the burglar. The burglar runs across moorland; the policemen follow him. Dick Barton theme music. The burglar lures the policemen into a large packing crate, slams the door on them and nails on it a label: 'Do not open until Christmas'. In the background a policeman with a fairy tutu appears suddenly out of thin air. He waves his wand at the burglar, who disappears. Cut to policeman, with wand, standing in a street.

Policeman

Yes, we in Special Crime Squad have been using wands for almost a year now. You find it's easy to make yourself invisible. You can defy time and space, and you can turn violent criminals into frogs. Something which you could never do with the old truncheons.

'Panorama' music and still photos of policemen in tutus.

CAPTION: 'PROBE AROUND'

Cut to interviewer at desk of 'Panorama' type set-up.

First Interviewer

Yes, tonight 'Probe Around' takes a look at crime...

A shot rings out and he slumps backward. A second interviewer runs into shot from behind camera with smoking gun.

Second Interviewer

I'm sorry about that, but I always introduce this programme, not him.

Second Interviewer

he pushes the first interviewer off his chair with his foot and takes his place

Second Interviewer

Yes, tonight 'Probe Around' takes a look at Crime. Is it true that the police are using dachshunds to combat the crime wave? And can the head of the Vice Squad turn himself into an albatross whenever he wants to? Just what are the police up to?

Cut to close-up of a constable reading big book. He is very, very, very stupid.

Policeman

Oh, I'm up to page 39, where Peter Pan first manifests himself.

Cut back to interviewer.

Second Interviewer

With me now is Inspector Harry H 'Snapper' Organs of 'H' Division.

Cut to another part of the 'Panorama' set. Detective Inspector Organs is sitting next to a Viking.

Organs

Good evening.

Cut back to interviewer and hereafter cross cut between them.

Interviewer

Er, Inspector, I believe you are encouraging magic in the Police Force?

Organs

That is correct.

Organs

as he speaks we notice he is sticking pins into a model of a burglar

Organs

The criminal mind is a strange and contorted one. Good evening. The mind is subject to severe mental stresses. Good evening. Guilt fears abound, good evening. In the subconscious in this state, one of our lads, with a fair training in the black arts can scare the fertilizer out of them.

Interviewer

Just how are the police combating the increase with the use of the occult? Ex-King Zog of Albania reports ...

Interviewer

phone rings

Interviewer

Well we seem to have lost ex-King Zog there, but who cares. Just what kinds of magic are the police introducing into their crime prevention techniques?

Cut to four chief constables huddled round an Ouija board. The have their fingers on a tumbler which moves slowly from one letter to the next.

Policemen

U-P Y-O-U-R-S.

Second Policeman

Up yours? What a rude Ouija board!

Cut to more film: policeman with wand. By pointing the wand at illegally parked cars he makes them disappear. Another policeman on the pavement helping an old lady across road. He looks to see if the road is clear, waves his wand and she jumps across to other side. Another street: a police siren is heard then five policemen on broom sticks appear from round corner and disappear across frame.

Cut to police dancing round Stonehenge. A burglar is bound to a stone altar. Mix to picture of same thing in newspaper which is being read by a chief constable in his office.

Chief Constable

Now this is the kind of thing that gives the police a bad name, sergeant.

Pull out further to reveal police sergeant in long shimmering slim-fitting ladies evening gown, diamante handbag and helmet.

Sergeant

Beryl

Attila the Hun, sir.

Chief Constable

Oh botherkins! Er, constable, go and see to him will you?

Sergeant

What! In this dress?

Chief Constable

Oh all right, I'll go.

Sergeant

Oh, I have got a little green pinny I could wear...

Chief Constable

No, no, no, I'll go. You stay here.

Sergeant

Oh goody! I can get on with the ironing.

The chief constable walks through the door into the reception area of the police station. There is a policeman behind the counter and a little insignificant man is standing waiting.

Chief Constable

to policeman

Chief Constable

Right where is he?

Beryl

Over there, sir.

Chief Constable

Right, er, all right sergeant leave this to me. Er, now then sir, you are Attila the Hun.

Attila the Hun

That's right, yes. A. T. Hun. My parents were Mr and Mrs Norman Hun, but they had a little joke when I was born.

Chief Constable

Yes well, Mr Hun ...

Attila

Oh! Call me 'The', for heaven's sake!

Chief Constable

Oh well, The... what do you want to see us about?

Attila

I've come to give myself up.

Chief Constable

What for?

Attila

Looting, pillaging and sacking a major city.

Chief Constable

I beg your pardon?

Attila

Looting, pillaging, sacking a major city, and I'd like nine thousand other charges to be taken into consideration, please.

Chief Constable

I say, excuse me, Mr Hun.

Chief Constable

he takes his hat off, removes his moustache, puts it in the hat and puts the hat back on

Chief Constable

Have you any objection to taking a breath test?

Attila

Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

Chief Constable

Right, er, sergeant will you bring the Hunalyser, please?

The constable produces a breathalyser.

Beryl

Here we are, sir.

Hands it to the chief constable.

Chief Constable

Er, how's it work?

Beryl

Well he breathes into it, sir, and the white crystals turn lime green. Then he is Attila the Hun, sir.

Chief Constable

I see. Right. Would you mind breathing into this Mr Hun?

Attila

Right.

Attila

blows into bag

Chief Constable

What if nothing happens, sergeant?

Beryl

He's Alexander the Great!

Chief Constable

Ha, ha! Caught you, Mr A. T. Great!

Attila

who is now Alexander the Great

Attila

Oh curses! Curses! I thought I was safe, disguised as Attila the Hun.

Chief Constable

Oh perhaps so, but you made one fatal mistake... you see, this wasn't a Hunalyser... it was an Alexander the Greatalyser Take him away, Beryl!

Cut to letter (as used for 'Xmas night with the stars' after pet shop. I'm sorry...as not used in 'Xmas night with the stars').

First Voice Over

Dear Sir, I object very strongly to that last scene, and to the next letter.

Cut to second letter.

Second Voice Over

Dear Sir, I object to being objected to by the last letter, before my drift has become apparent. I spent many years in India during the last war and am now a part-time notice board in a prominent public school. Yours etc., Brigadier Zoe La Rue (deceased). PS Aghhh!

Cut to third letter.

Third Voice Over

Dear Sir, When I was at school, I was beaten regularly every thirty minutes, and it never did me any harm - except for psychological maladjusunent and blurred vision. Yours truly, Flight Lieutenant Ken Frankenstein (Mrs).

Psychiatrist

Er, nurse!

Receptionist

Yes?

Psychiatrist

Psychiatrist

Er, you don't think you should make it clear that I'm a psychiatrist?

Receptionist

What?

Psychiatrist

Well, I could be any type of doctor.

Receptionist

Well I can't come in and say 'Psychiatrist Larch' or 'Dr Larch who is a psychiatrist'. Oh, anyway look, it's written on the door.

Psychiatrist

Psychiatrist

That's outside.

Receptionist

Well, I don't care, you'll just have to do it yourself.

Receptionist

Psychiatrist

Psychiatrist

Psychiatrist

Er, come in.

Phelps comes in dressed as Napoleon, with a parrot on his head, and a leash with nothing on it.

Phelps

Bow, wow, wow.

Psychiatrist

Ah Mr Phelps. Come on in, take a seat. Now what seems to be the matter?

Phelps

No, no, no. No. No.

Psychiatrist

I'm sorry?

Phelps

Oh can't you do better than that? I mean it's so predictable I've seen it a million times. Knock, knock, knock come in, ah Mr Phelps take a seat. I've seen it and seen it.

Psychiatrist

Well look will you please sit down and do your first line.

Phelps

No. No. I've had enough. I've had enough.

Cut to a man in limbo: Mr Notlob.

Notlob

A mad psychiatrist, that'd be new.

Cut back to the psychiatrist.

Psychiatrist

Knocking at door. Psychiatrist is about to call when he picks up a thesaurus and thumbs through it.

Psychiatrist

Cross the threshold, arrive, ingress, gain admittance, infiltrate.

Psychiatrist

Notlob enters in an ordinary suit

Psychiatrist

Ah Mr Notlob, ah park your hips, on the sitting device.

Notlob

Notlob

It is a mad psychiatrist.

Psychiatrist

I'm not. I'm not. Come on in. Take a seat. What's, what's the matter?

Cut to Napoleon in limbo; he blows a raspberry.

Psychiatrist

Now what's the matter?

Notlob

Well I keep hearing guitars playing and people singing when there's no one around.

Psychiatrist

Yes, well this is not at all uncommon. In certain mental states we find that auditory hallucinations occur which are of a most ...

Psychiatrist

he steps suddenly and listens; the sound of 'We're all going to the zoo tomorrow' is heard

Psychiatrist

Is that 'We're all going to the zoo tomorrow'?

Notlob

Yes. Yes.

Psychiatrist

Is it always that?

Notlob

No.

Psychiatrist

Well that's something.

Notlob

But it's mainly folk songs.

Psychiatrist

concerned

Psychiatrist

Oh my God.

Notlob

Last night I had 'I'll never fall in love again' for six hours.

Psychiatrist

Well look, I think I'd better have a second opinion on this. I want you to see a colleague of mine, a specialist in these sort of things, who has an office very much like this one as a matter of fact.

Jump cut off same office now occupied by a surgeon. Start on portrait which has moustache and beard and glasses being added by surgeon.

Surgeon

Notlob enters; 'Going to the zoo' is faintly heard

Surgeon

cut to terribly quick shot of Napoleon, then back

Surgeon

he is rising from seat

Surgeon

he puts needle down on ancient gramophone; Dr Kildare theme begins playing

Surgeon

I'm afraid I'm going to have to operate. It's nothing to worry about although it is extremely dangerous. I shall be juggling with your life, I shall be playing ducks and drakes with your very existence, I shall be running me mitts over the pith of your marrow. Yes! These hands, these fingers, these sophisticated organs of touch, these bunches of five, these maulers, these German bands that have pulled many a moribund unfortunate back from the very brink of Lazarus's box. No, it was Pandora's box wasn't it? Well anyway these mitts have earned yours truly a lot of bread. So if you'll just step through here I'll slit you up a treat.

Notlob

What?

Surgeon

Mr Notlob, there's nothing wrong with you that an expensive operation can't prolong.

Cut to operating theatre. The conversation and the guitar can still be heard. Notlob is on the table. His head is real but the rest of the body is false. Table is covered with green cloth for reality. Surgeon is swabbing. 'Going to the zoo' is still audible.

Surgeon

Right, I'm ready to make the incision. Knife please, sister

Surgeon

takes knife

Surgeon

takes big knife and strops it on steel sharpener

Surgeon

he stabs the body and makes a slit four feet long

Surgeon

Oh what a great slit. Now, gentlemen, I am going to open the slit.

He pulls it apart. The song gets louder. The head of a squatter pops out.

Squatter

Too much man, groovy, great scene. Great light show, baby.

Surgeon

What are you doing in there?

Squatter

We're doing our own thing, man.

Surgeon

Have you got Mr Nottob's permission to be in there?

Squatter

We're squatters, baby.

Surgeon

What?

Surgeon

to nurse about Notlob

Surgeon

she slaps his face

Squatter

Don't get uptight, man. Join the scene and other phrases. Money isn't real.

Surgeon

It is where I'm standing and it blows my mind, young lad.

Surgeon

looks inside Notlob

Surgeon

Good Lord! Is that a nude woman?

Squatter

She's doing an article on us for 'Nova', man.

Girl

Girl

Hi everyone. Are you part of the scene?

Surgeon

Are you rolling your own jelly babies in there?

Notlob

Notlob

What's going on? Who are they?

Surgeon

That's what we are trying to find out.

Notlob

What are they doing in my stomach?

Surgeon

We don't know. Are they paying you any rent?

Notlob

Of course they're not paying me rent!

Squatter

You're not furnished, you fascist.

Notlob

Get them out!

Surgeon

I can't.

Notlob

Get them out.

Surgeon

No I can't. Not, not without a court order.

SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'FACE THE PRESS'

Interviewer

Hello. Tonight on 'Face the Press' we're going to examine two different views of contemporary things. On my left is the Minister for Home Affairs

Interviewer

Interviewer

soft fashion-parade music starts to play in background

Interviewer

cut to patch of liquid on seat of chair

Interviewer

cut back to interviewer

Interviewer

Good evening. Minister, may I put the first question to you? In your plan, 'A Better Britain For Us', you claimed that you would build 88,000 million, billion houses a year in the Greater London area alone. In fact, you've built only three in the last fifteen years. Are you a bit disappointed with this result?

Minister

No, no. I'd like to answer this question if I may in two ways. Firstly in my normal voice and then in a kind of silly high-pitched whine... You see housing is a problem really...

Cut back to the interviewer. The minister is heard droning on in the background. The soft fashion-parade music starts again.

Interviewer

Well, while the minister is answering this question I'd just like to point out the minister's dress has been made entirely by hand from over three hundred pieces of Arabian shot silk

Interviewer

at this point we can hear the minister's high-pitched whine beneath the fashion music

Interviewer

especially created for the minister by Vargar's of Paris. The low slim-line has been cut off-the-shoulder to heighten the effect of the minister's fine bone structure. Well I think the minister is coming to the end of his answer now so let's go back over and join the discussion. Thank you very much minister. Today saw the appointment of a new head of...

Minister

Don't I say any more?

Interviewer

No fear! Today saw the appointment of a new head of Allied Bomber Command - Air Chief Marshal Sir Vincent 'Kill the Japs' Forster. He's in our Birmingham studio...

Cut to close-up on what appears to be a monitor with Sir Vincent on it in outrageous drag, heavy lipstick, big bust etc. - Draped on a chaise-longue. A small black boy is fanning him.

Sir Vincent

Hello Sailors! Listen, guess what. The Minister of Aviation has made me head of the RAF Ola Pola.

As he talks we zoom out quickly from the set to reveal it is not a monitor in the studio but a TV set in a G-plan type sitting room. A housewife (Mrs Pinnet) sits watching, wearing an apron and a scarf and with her hair in curlers. The doorbell sounds. She switches the TV off and answers the door which opens straight into the living room. There in the street stands a truly, amazing figure of fun. A man in a bowler hat with an axe sticking out of it, big red joke nose, illuminated bow tie that revolves, joke broad shoulders, clown's check jacket, long johns with sock suspenders, heavy army boots and leading a goat with a hat. Close-up.

Man

Hello. Mrs Rogers?

Mrs Pinnet

No. Ooh I must be in the wrong house,

She shuts the door on him and we follow her as she crosses the room. She climbs out of the window. Back yard of terraced house. She scrambles over a quite high dividing wall into next door and starts to scramble into next-door window.

Interior of a more cluttered working-dass sitting-room. There is a TV in there with Sir Vincent still camping it up.

Sir Vincent

So from now on we're going to do things my way. For a start David Hockney is going to design the bombs. And I've seen the plans...

The doorbell rings.

Mrs Pinnet

That must be the new gas cooker.

She switches the TV off. Immediate thunderous epic music.

SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION:

in stone lettering, as for Ben Hur

Both caption and music switch off suddenly as she opens the door. Outside the door are two gas men with a new cooker.

First Gas Man

Morning. Mrs G. Crump?

Mrs Pinnet

No - Mrs G. Pinnet.

First Gas Man

This is 46 Egernon Crescent?

Mrs Pinnet

No - Road. Egernon Road.

First Gas Man

looks at a bit of paper

First Gas Man

Road, yes, says here. Yeah. Right, could I speak to Mrs G. Crump please?

Mrs Pinnet

Oh there's nobody here of that name. It's Mrs G. Pinnet. 46 Egernon Road.

First Gas Man

Well it says 'Crump' here. Don't it, Harry?

Second Gas Man

Yeah - it's on the invoice.

First Gas Man

Yeah, definitely Crump.

Mrs Pinnet

Well there must have been a mistake, because the address is right, and that's definitely the cooker I ordered - a blue and white CookEasi.

First Gas Man

Well you can't have this. This is Crump.

Mrs Pinnet

Oh dear, what are we going to do?

First Gas Man

Well I don't know. What we can do for you is take it back to the Depot, get a transfer slip from Crump to Pinnet, and put it on a special delivery.

Second Gas Man

Yeah - that's best. We'll special it for you, we'll get it down there today and you'll get it back in ten weeks.

Mrs Pinnet

Ten weeks! Blimey, can't you just leave this one?

First Gas Man

What this? What leave it here?

First Gas Man

they seem thunderstruck

Mrs Pinnet

Yes.

First Gas Man

Well I dunno. I suppose we could.

Second Gas Man

Oh, but she'd have to fill out a temporary despatch note.

First Gas Man

Yeah we could leave it on a temporary despatch note.

Mrs Pinnet

Well that's sorted out then. What a mess, isn't it.

First Gas Man

I know, it's ridiculous really, but there you are. Glad we could be of such a help. Right, would you sign it down there please, Mrs Crump?

Mrs Pinnet

Pinnet.

First Gas Man

Pinnet. Listen, just for the books make it a bit easier, could you sign it Crump-Pinnet.

Mrs Pinnet

Right.

Mrs Pinnet

she signs

First Gas Man

Right. Thank you very much, dear. The cooker's yours. Right. Thank you very much, dear. Right.

First Gas Man

they push it just inside the door and move off

First Gas Man

Sorry about the bother... but there you are ... you know ... cheerio!

Second Gas Man

Cheerio, Mrs Crump!

Mrs Pinnet

Heh, excuse me! Cooey! Er, can you put it in the kitchen?

First Gas Man

coming back

First Gas Man

You what?

Mrs Pinnet

Well I can't cook on it unless it's connected up.

First Gas Man

Oh we didn't realize you had an installation invoice.

Second Gas Man

An MI.

First Gas Man

No, we can't touch it without an MI, you see.

Second Gas Man

Or an R16.

Third Gas Man

who is suddenly revealed behind the two of them

Third Gas Man

If it's a special.

Second Gas Man

Nah - it's not special ... the special's back at the Depot.

First Gas Man

No, the special's the same as installation invoice.

Third Gas Man

So it's an R16.

Mrs Pinnet

What's an installation invoice?

First Gas Man

A pink form from Reading.

Mrs Pinnet

Oh - we wondered what that was. Now these are the forms.

Mrs Pinnet

she produces a large wad of papers, sorts through and products a pink form which she hands to them

First Gas Man

That's the one, love. Yeah, this should be all I need. Hang on. This is for Pinnet. Mrs G. Pinnet.

Mrs Pinnet

That's right. I'm Mrs G. Pinnet.

First Gas Man

Well we've got Crump-Pinnet on the invoice.

Mrs Pinnet

Well shall I sign it Crump-Pinnet then?

First Gas Man

No, no, no - not an MI - no.

Second Gas Man

No - that's from Area Service at Reading.

Fourth Gas Man

suddenly revealed

Fourth Gas Man

No, Cheltenham isn't it?

Second Gas Man

No, not this side of the street.

Mrs Pinnet

Look I just want it connected up.

Much doubtfulness.

Third Gas Man

What about London Office?

First Gas Man

Well they haven't got the machinery.

Second Gas Man

Not now.

Fifth Gas Man

suddenly, revealed

Fifth Gas Man

What! The Hounslow Depot?

Fourth Gas Man

No - they're still on standard pressure.

Sixth Gas Man

suddenly revealed

Sixth Gas Man

Same with Twickenham.

Mrs Pinnet

But surely they can connect up a gas cooker?

First Gas Man

Oh yeah, we could connect it up, love, but not unless it's an emergency.

Mrs Pinnet

But this

Mrs Pinnet

is

Mrs Pinnet

an emergency.

First Gas Man

No it's not. An emergency is 290... 'where there is actual or apparent loss of combustible gaseous substances'.

Second Gas Man

Yeah, it's like a leak.

Seventh gas man is revealed.

Seventh Gas Man

Yeah, or a 478.

Third Gas Man

No - that's valve adjustment.

Mrs Pinnet

But there can't be a leak unless you've connected it up.

First Gas Man

No, quite. We'd have to turn it on.

Mrs Pinnet

Well can't you turn it on

Mrs Pinnet

and

Mrs Pinnet

connect it up?

First Gas Man

No. But what we can do, and this is between you and me, I shouldn't really be telling you this, we'll turn your gas on, make a hole in your pipe, you ring Hounslow emergency, they'll be around here in a couple of days.

Mrs Pinnet

What, a house full of gas! I'll be dead by then

First Gas Man

Oh well, in that case you'd have the South East Area Manager round here like a shot.

Mrs Pinnet

Really?

First Gas Man

Ah yes. 'One or more persons overcome by fumes', you'd have Head Office, Holbom, round here.

First Gas Man

Yes. That's murder you see.

Second Gas Man

Or suicide.

Fifth Gas Man

No. That's S42.

Second Gas Man

Oh.

Eighth gas man is revealed.

Eighth Gas Man

Still? I thought it was Hainault.

Fifth Gas Man

No - Central area and Southall Marketing Division, they're both on the S42 now.

Mrs Pinnet

And they'd be able to connect it up?

First Gas Man

Oh - they'd do the lot for you, love.

Mrs Pinnet

And they'd come round this afternoon?

First Gas Man

... Well what is it now... 11:30... murder... they'll be round here by two.

Mrs Pinnet

Oh well that's wonderful.

First Gas Man

Oh well, right love, if you'd like to lie down here.

Mrs Pinnet

All right.

Mrs Pinnet

she does so

First Gas Man

Okay Harry.

Second Gas Man

Okay. Gas on.

First Gas Man

holding a gas pipe to her mouth

First Gas Man

Right, deep breaths love. Ring Head Office would you Norman...

Fourth Gas Man

Shall I go through maintenance?

Fifth Gas Man

No, you'd better go through Deptford maintenance.

Sixth Gas Man

Peckham's on a 207 .... .

Voices

The camera pans along line of gas men all turning to each other and muttering incomprehensible technicalities, the line stretches across to front door. Line continues outside in street and goes into animation sequences which eventually brings us to a close-up on a small ad, which is one of many on the door of a small newsagent's shop. A shabby man is running an evil eye down the adverts, puzzling, looking for something. He walks up to the counter. He has a reflex wink.

Customer

Good morning.

Shopkeeper

Good morning, sir. Can I help you?

Customer

Help me? Yeah, I'll say you can help me.

Shopkeeper

Yes, sir?

Customer

I come about your advert - 'Small white pussy cat for sale. Excellent condition'.

Shopkeeper

Ah. You wish to buy it?

Customer

That's right. Just for the hour. Only I aint gonna pay more'n a fiver cos it aint worth it.

Shopkeeper

Well it's come from a very good home - it's house trained.

Customer

Chest of drawers? Chest. Drawers. I'd like some chest of drawers please.

Shopkeeper

Oh good, I like them in good condition, eh? Eh?

Customer

Customer

Blond prostitute will indulge in any sexual activity for four quid a week. What does that mean?

A city gent comes into shop. He has a silly walk and keeps doing little jumps and then three long paces without moving the top of his body. He buys a paper, then we follow him as he leaves the shop.

City Gent

'Times' please.

Shopkeeper

Oh yes sir, here you are.

City Gent

Thank you.

Shopkeeper

Cheers.

The city gent leaves the shop, from which we see a line of gas men stretching back up the road to Mrs Pinnet's house, and walks off in an indescribably silly manner. Cut to him proceeding along Whitehall, and into a building labelled 'Ministry of Silly Walks '. Inside the building he passes three other men, each walking in their own eccentric way. Cut to an office; a man is sitting waiting. The city gent enters eccentrically.

Minister

Good morning. I'm sorry to have kept you waiting, but I'm afraid my walk has become rather sillier recently, and so it takes me rather longer to get to work.

Minister

sits at desk

Minister

Now then, what was it again?

Man

Well sir, I have a silly walk and I'd like to obtain a Government grant to help me develop it.

Minister

I see. May I see your silly walk?

Man

Yes, certainly, yes.

He gets up and does a few steps, lifting the bottom part of his left leg sharply at every alternate pace. He stops.

Minister

That's it, is it?

Man

Yes, that's it, yes.

Minister

It's not particularly silly, is it? I mean, the right leg isn't silly at all and the left leg merely does a forward aerial half turn every alternate step.

Man

Yes, but I think that with Government backing I could make it very silly.

Minister

rising

Minister

he walks about behind the desk in a very silly fashion

Minister

he sits down

Minister

Coffee?

Man

Yes please.

Minister

pressing intercorn

Minister

Now Mrs Two-Lumps, would you bring us in two coffees please?

Intercom Voice

Yes, Mr Teabag.

Minister

... Out of her mind. Now the Japanese have a man who can bend his leg back over his head and back again with every single step. While the Israelis... ah, here's the coffee.

Enter secretary with tray with two cups on it. She has a particularly jerky silly walk which means that by the time she reaches the minister there is no coffee left in the cups. The minister has a quick look in the cups, and smiles understandingly.

Minister

Thank you - lovely.

Minister

she exits still carrying tray and cups

Minister

You're really interested in silly walks, aren't you?

Man

Oh rather. Yes.

Minister

Well take a look at this, then.

He products a projector from beneath his desk already spooled up and plugged in. He flicks a switch and it beams onto the opposite wall. The film shows a sequence of six old-fashioned silly walkers. The film is old silent-movie type, scratchy, jerky and 8mm quality. All the participants wear 1900's type costume. One has huge shoes with soles a foot thick, one is a woman, one has. very long 'Little Tich' shoes. Cut back to office. The minister hurls the projector away. Along with papers and everything else on his desk. He leans foward.

Minister

Now Mr Pudey. I'm not going to mince words with you. I'm going to offer you a Research Fellowship on the Anglo-French silly walk.

Man

La Marche Futile?

Cut to two Frenchmen, wearing striped jerseys and berets, standing in a field with a third man who is entirely covered by a sheet.

First Frenchman

Bonjour ... et maintenant ... comme d'habitude, au sujet du Le Marché Commun. Et maintenant, je vous presente, encore une fois, mon ami, le pouf célèbre, Jean-Brian Zatapathique.

First Frenchman

he removes his moustache and sticks it onto the other Frenchman

Second Frenchman

Merci, mon petit chou-chou Brian Trubshawe. Et maintenant avec les pieds à droite, et les pieds au gauche, et maintenant l'Anglais-Française Marche Futile, et voilà

They unveil the third man and walk off. He is facing to camera left and appears to be dressed as a city gent; then he turns about face and we see on his right half he is dressed au style francais. He moves off into the distance in eccentric speeded-up motion.

Exterior in street; interviewer and Mrs Simnel. Line of gas men behind.

Mrs Simmel

Kipling Road was a typical sort of Eastend street, people were in and out of each other's houses with each other's property all day. They were a cheery lot.

Interviewer

Was it a terribly violent area?

Mrs Simmel

laughs deprecatingly

Mrs Simmel

Oh ho......yes. Cheerful and violent. I remember Doug was very keen on boxing, until he learned to walk, then he took up putting the boot in the groin. Oh he was very interested in that. His mother had such trouble getting him to come in for his tea. He'd be out there putting his little boot in, you know, bless him. You know kids were very different then. They didn't have their heads filled with all this Cartesian dualism.

Cut to scool playground.

At the age of fifteen Doug and Dinsdale started attending the Ernest Pythagoras Primary School in Clerkenwell.

Pan to show Anthony Viney and interviewer with stick mike.

Interviewer

Anthony Viney. You taught the Piranha brothers English. What do you remember most about them?

He fails to point stick mike at Viney (graham) who answers. However, when the interviewer poses the next question he points the stick mike to Viney as he does so. This continues, with the mike always pointing to the one who is not talking while Viney relates a fascinating tale complete with large riveting gestures.

Interviewer

...Anthoney Viney.

Cut to presenter.

Presenter

When the Piranhas left school they were called up but were found by an Army Board to be too unstable even for National Service. Denied the opportunity to use their talents in the service of their country, they began to operate what they called 'The Operation'. They would select a victim and then threaten to beat him up if he paid the so-called protection money. Four months later they started another operation which the called 'The Other Operation'. In this racket they selected another victim and threatened

Presenter

not

Presenter

didn't

Presenter

pay them. One month later they hit upon 'The Other Other Operation'. In this the victim was threatened that if he didn't pay them, they would beat him up. This for the Piranha brothers was the turning point.

Cut to Superintendent Organs

SUBTITLE: 'HARRY "SNAPPER" ORGANS'

Organs

Doug and Dinsdale Piranha now formed a gang, which the called 'The Gang' and used terror to take over night clubs, billiard halls, gaming casinos and race tracks. When they tried to take over the MCC they were for the only time in their lives, slit up a treat. As their empire spread however, we in Q Division were keeping tabs on their every move by reading the colour supplements.

Presenter

A small-time operator who fell foul of Dinsdale Piranha was Vince Snetterton-Lewis.

Cut to Vince in a chair in a nasty flat.

Vince

Well one day I was sitting at home threatening the kids, and I looked out of the hole in the wall and sees this tank drive up and one of Dinsdale's boys gets out and he comes up, all nice and friendly like, and says Dinsdale wants to have a talk with me. So he chains me to the back of the tank and takes me for a scrape round to Dinsdale's. And Dinsdale's there in the conversation pit with Doug and Charles Paisley, the baby crusher, and a couple of film producers and a man they called 'Kierkegaard', who just sat there biting the heads of whippets and Dinsdale sayd 'I hear you've been a naughty boy Clement' and he splits me nostrils open and saws me leg off and pulls me liver out, and I said my name's not Clement and then he loses his temper and nails my head to the floor.

He nailed your head to the floor?

Another man who had his head nailed to the floor was Stig O' Tracey.

Cut to another younger more cheerful man on sofa.

Interviewer

Stig, I've been told Dinsdale Piranha nailed your head to the floor.

Stig

No, no. Never, never. He was a smashing bloke. He used to give his mother flowers and that. He was like a brother to me.

Interviewer

But the police have film of Dinsdale actually nailing your head to the floor.

Stig

Oh yeah, well - he did that, yeah.

Interviewer

Why?

Stig

Well he had to, didn't he? I mean, be fair, there was nothing else he could do. I mean, I had transgressed the unwritten law.

Interviewer

What had you done?

Stig

Er... Well he never told me that. But he gave me his word that it was the case, and that's good enough for me with old Dinsy. I mean, he didn't want to nail my head to the floor. I had to insist. He wanted to let me off. There's nothing Dinsdale wouldn't do for you.

Interviewer

And you don't bear him any grudge?

Stig

A grudge! Old Dinsy? He was a real darling.

Interviewer

I understand he also nailed your wife's head to a coffee table. Isn't that right Mrs O' Tracey?

Camera pans to show woman with coffee table nailed to head.

Mrs O' Tracey

Oh, no. No. No.

Stig

Yeah, well, he did do that. Yeah, yeah. He was a cruel man, but fair

Cut back to Vince.

Interviewer

Vince, after he nailed your head to the floor, did you ever see him again

Vince

Yeah.....after that I used to go round his flat every Sunday lunchtime to apologize and we'd shake hands and then he'd nail my head to the floor

Interviewer

Every Sunday?

Vince

Yeah but he was very reasonable about it. I mean one Sunday when my parents were coming round for tea, I asked him if he'd mind very much not nailing my head to the floor that week and he agreed and just screwed my pelvis to a cake stand.

Clearly Dinsdale inspired tremendous loyalty and terror amongst his business associates, but what was he really like?

Cut to a bar.

Gloria

I walked out with Dinsdale on many occasions and found him a most charming and erudite companion. He was wont to introduce one to eminent persons, celebrated American singers, members of the aristocracy and other gang leaders.

Interviewer

off screen

Interviewer

How had he met them?

Gloria

Through his work for charity. He took a warm interest in Boys' Clubs, Sailors' Homes, Choristers' Associations, Scouting Jamborees and of course the Household Cavalry.

Interviewer

Was there anything unusual about him?

Gloria

I should say not. Dinsdale was a perfectly normal person in every way. Except is as much as he was convinced that he was being watched by a giant hedgehog whom he referred to as Spiny Norman.

Interviewer

How big was Norman supposed to be?

Gloria

Normally he was wont to be about twelve feet from nose to tail, but when Dinsdale was

Gloria

very

Gloria

depressed Norman could be anything up to eight hundred yards long. When Norman was about, Dinsdale would go very quiet and his nose would swell up and his teeth would start moving about and he'd become very violent and claim that he'd laid Stanley Baldwin. Dinsdale was a gentleman. And what's more he knew how to treat a female impersonator.

I'm sorry. After all a murderer is only an extroverted suicide. Dinsdale was a looney, but he was a happy looney. Lucky bastard.

Most of the strange tales concern Dinsdale, but what about Doug? One man who met him was Luigi Vercotti.

Cut to tatty office with desk and phone. Vercotti at deak.

Anyway I decided then to open a high-class night club for the gentry at Biggleswade with International cuisine, cooking, top-line acts, and not a cheap clip joint for picking up tarts, that was right out, I deny that completely, and one night Dinsdale walked in with a couple of big lads, one of whom was carrying a tactical nuclear missile. They said I'd bought one of their fruit machines and would I pay for it.

Interviewer

How much did they want?

Vercotti

Three quarters of a million pounds. Then they went out.

Interviewer

Why didn't you call the police?

Vercotti

Well I had noticed that the lad with the thermo-nuclear device was the Chief Constable for the area. Anyway a week later they came back, said that the cheque had bounced and that I had to see Doug.

Interviewer

Doug?

I was terrified of him. Everyone was terrified of Doug. I've seen grown men pull their own heads off rather than see Doug. Even Dinsdale was frightened of Doug.

Organs

The Piranhas realized they had gone too far and that the hunt was on. They went into hiding and I decided on a subtle approach, viz some form of disguise, as the old helmet and boots are a bit of a giveaway. Luckily my years with Bristol Rep. stood me in good stead, as I assumed a bewildering variety of disguises. I tracked them to Cardiff, posing as the Reverend Smiler Egret. Hearing they'd gone back to London, I assumed the identity of a pork butcher, Brian Stoats.

Biggles turns an imaginary handle on the side of the rack. The doorbell rings. Reg detaches himself from the scene and answers it. Outside there is a dapper BBC man with a suit and a beard, slightly arty.

BBC Man

Ah, hello, you don't know me, but I'm from the BBC. We were wondering if you'd come and answer the door in a sketch over there, in that sort of direction... You wouldn't have to do anything - just open the door and that's it.

Oh, well all right, yes.

Jolly good. Come this way.

Yes that's right, that sort of thing, yes, a link. It's all a bit zany - you know a bit madcap funster... frankly I don't fully understand it myself, the kids seem to like it. I much prefer Des O'Connor ... Rolf Harris ... Tom Jones, you know...

They get into the van. It drives off. They pass an AA sign saying 'To the Sketch'. Panning shot of them, in which we see them convening and hear...

Reg

You do a lot of this sort of thing, do you?

BBC Man

Quite a lot yes, quite a lot. I'm mainly in comedy. I'd like to be in Programming Planning actually, but unfortunately I've got a degree.

They arrive outside a suburban house, where the novelty salesman, Mr Johnson, is already waiting outside the front door. BBC man points and gives Reg direction. Reg goes to the door saying: 'Excuse me' and goes in, closing the front door. The novelty man rings bell. Reg opens the door.

Embarrass your guests - completely authentic sound. Or why not try a new 'naughty nightie' - put it on and it melts - just watch their faces. Guaranteed to break the ice at naughty parties. Go on, go on.

Ah - can do. But won't. We were wondering if we could possibly borrow your head for a piece of animation.

Oh jolly good. Thanks very much. You will get expenses.

BBC staff set on Reg and saw his head off.

Man In Bowler Hat

To boost the British economy I'd tax all foreigners living abroad.

Man In Suit

I would tax the nude in my bed. No - not tax. What is the word? Oh - 'welcome'.

It's Man

I would tax Racquel Welch. I've a feeling she'd tax me.

First Business Man

Bring back hanging and go into rope.

Second Business Man

I would cut off the more disreputable parts of the body and use the space for playing fields.

Man In Cap

I would tax holiday snaps.

Freeze frame. Cut to snapshot of same stil which is being held by a dear old lady. Pull out to reveal she is sitting with a large photo album on her knees, lovingly extracting photos from the piles on top of the album and passing them to her friend sitting on the same settee. Her friend is a young lady, who tears up the photos as they are handed to her. The dear old lady is in a world of her own and does not notice.

Dear Old Lady

This is Uncle Ted in front of the house.

Dear Old Lady

she hand over the photo and the young lady tears it up

Dear Old Lady

And the is the Spanish Inquisition hiding behind the coal shed.

Friend takes it with the first sign of real interest.

Young Lady

Oh! I didn't expect a Spanish Inquisition.

Jarring chord. The door flies open and Ximinez, Biggles and Fang enter.

Ximinez

Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!

THIS WAS THE SPANISH INQUISITION...'

Torchlit dungeon. We hear clanging footsteps. Shadows on the Grille. The footsteps stop and keys jangle. The great door creaks open and Ximinez walks in and looks round approvingly. Fang and Biggles enter behind pushing in the dear old lady. They chain her to the wall.

Ximinez

Now, old woman! You are accused of heresy on three counts. Heresy by thought, heresy by word, heresy by deed, and heresy by action.

Ximinez

Four

counts. Do you confess?

Dear Old Lady

I don't understand what I'm accused of.

Ximinez

Ha! Then we shall

Ximinez

Jarring chord. Biggles holds out two ordinary modern household cushions.

Biggles

Here they are, lord.

Now, old lady, you have one last chance. Confess the heinous sin of heresy, reject the works of the ungodly -

Ximinez

two

Ximinez

Ximinez

Dear Old Lady

I don't know what you're talking about.

Right! If that's the way you want it - Cardinal! Poke her with the soft cushions!

Ximinez

Biggles carries out this rather pathetic torture

Ximinez

Confess! Confess! Confess!

Biggles

It doesn't seem to be hurting her, my lord.

Ximinez

Have you got all the stuffing up one end?

Biggles

Yes, lord.

Ximinez

angrily hurling away the cushions

Ximinez

Hm! She is made of harder stuff! Cardinal Fang - fetch...the comfy chair!

Another loud jarring chord. Zoom in on Fang's horrified face.

Fang

The comfy chair?

Fang pushes in a comfy chair - a really plush one.

Ximinez

So you think you are strong because you can survive the soft cushions. Well, we shall see. Biggles! Put her in the Comfy Chair!

Ximinez

Biggles roughly push her into the comfy chair

Ximinez

Ximinez

Is that really all it is?

Biggles

Why, yes lord.

Clerk

a very elderly judge in full robes comes into the dock

Clerk

If I may charge you m'lud, you are charged m'lud that on the fourteenth day of June 1970, at the Central Criminal Court, you did commit acts likely to cause a breach of the peace. How plead you m'lud, guilty or not guilty?

Judge Kilbraken

Not guilty. Case not proven. Court adjourned.

He hits the dock. Everyone gets up and starts walking out talking to each other.

Judge

No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Judge

they all stop, go back and sit down again

Judge

No, you're in the dock, m'lud.

Judge Kilbraken

I'm a judge, m'lud.

Judge

So am I, m'lud, so watch it.

Judge Kilbraken

Hah! Call this a court.

All

Call this a court. Call this a court..Call this a court.

Judge

Shut up. Right now get on with the spiel.

Counsel

M'lud, and my other lud, the prosecution will endeavour to show m'lud, that m'lud - ah, not you m'lud, that m'lud, m'lud, while passing sentence at the Central Criminal Court blotted his copy book. Call exhibit Q.

Judge

Q?

Counsel

Sorry did I say Q? I meant A. Sorry, call exhibit A.

Clerk

Call exhibit A.

Two court ushers carry in a thing with a sheet over it. They pull off the sheet to reveal a very sexy girl in a provocative pose.

Counsel

Exhibit A m'lud, Miss Rita Thang, an artist's model, Swedish accordion teacher and cane-chair sales lady, was found guilty under the Rude Behaviour Act in the accused's court. The accused, m'lud, sentenced her to be taken from this place and brought round to his place.

Second Counsel

Objection, m'lud.

Judge Kilbraken

Objection sustained.

Judge

You shut up! Objection overruled.

Counsel

The accused then commented on Miss Thang's bodily structure, made several not-at-all legal remarks on the subject of fun and then placed his robes over his head and began to emit low moans.

Judge

Have you anything to say in your defense?

Judge Kilbraken

I haven't had any for weeks.

Judge

Oh no? What about that little number you've got tucked away in Belsize Park?

Judge Kilbraken

Oh, I never!

Judge

Oh no. Ho! Ho! Ho!

Judge Kilbraken

All right then what about 8a Woodford Square?

Judge

You say anything about that and I'll do you for treason.

Counsel

M'lud if we could continue ...

Judge Kilbraken

He's got a Chinese bit there.

Judge

No, that's contempt of court.

Judge Kilbraken

It was only a joke.

Judge

Contempt of court. However, I'm not going to punish you, because we're so short of judges at the moment, what with all of them emigrating to South Africa. I'm going tomorrow; I've got my ticket. Get out there and get some decent sentencing done. Ooh, England makes you sick. Best I can manage here is life imprisonment. It's hardly worth coming in in the morning. Now, South Africa? You've got your cat of nine tails, you've got four death sentences a week, you've got cheap drinks, slave labour and a booming stock market. I'm off, I tell you. Yes, I'm up to here with probation and bleeding psychiatric reports. That's it, I'm off. That's it. Right. But I'm going to have one final fling before I leave, so I sentence you to be burnt at the stake.

Judge Kilbraken

Blimey! I didn't expect the Spanish Inquisition.

Court reacts expectantly. Cut to suburban house. The three members of the Spanish Inquisition suddenly belt out of the door and down the path. Dick Barton music. Cut to them leaping onto a bus.

Ximinez

Two, er, three to the Old Bailey please.

Credits start superimposed.

Biggles

Look they've started the credits.

Ximinez

Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.

Biggles

Come on hurry. Hurry!

We see shots of them coming through London.

Ximinez

There's the lighting credit, only five left.

Ximinez

more shots of the bus going through London; the credits reach the producer

Ximinez

Hell, it's the producer - quick!

They leap off the bus into the Old Bailey. Cut to court room. They burst in.

Ximinez

Nobody expects the Spa...

Ximinez

'The End' appears

Ximinez

Oh bugger!

Wide shot of enormous high block of flats. The camera seems to be searching. Suddenly it zooms in on one window. It is a bedroom...a busty girl is looking out the window. She stretches langourously and mouths.

Girl

dubbed on very badly

Girl

My, isn't it hot in here.

She starts to undress. She gets down to bra and panties, unhitches her bra and is about to slip it off her shoulders exposing her heavy bosoms when...the announcer rises up in front of the window on window cleaner's hoist.

Announcer

And now for something completely different.

Cut to an orchard or a woodland clearing, in which are a group of stuffed animals; a lion, a tiger, a cow, an elk, a leopard, two small ferrets and an owl on an overhanging branch. Sound of birdsong. The elk explodes.

Cut back to John still in front of the window. We can just see Carol behind him in the bedroom casting her panties to one side - that is we just see her arm.

Announcer

And now for something more completely different...

Cut to 'It's' man

It's Man

It's...

Animated titles.

Cut back to the same group of animals minus the elk. Birdsong etc. The elk's remains are smouldering. The owl explodes, Pan away from the woodland clearing to an open field in which at a distance a bishop in full mitre and robes is pacing up and down holding a script. Mr Chigger in a suit approaches the bishop and we zoom in to hear their conversation.

Bishop

'Oh Mr Belpit your legs are so swollen' ...

Bishop

swollen

Bishop

tries a different voice

Bishop

'Oh Mr Belpit., .'

Mr Chigger

Excuse me, excuse me. I saw your advertisement for flying lessons and I'd like to make an application.

Bishop

Nothing to do with me. I'm not in this show.

Mr Chigger

Oh I see. D'you ... d'you., . do you know about the flying lessons?

Bishop

Nothing to do with me. I'm not in this show. This is show five - I'm not in until show eight.

Mr Chigger

Oh I see.

Bishop

I'm just learning my lines, you know. 'Oh Mr Belpit, your legs...'

Mr Chigger

Bit awkward, I'm a bit stuck.

Bishop

Yes, well. Try over there.

Bishop points to a secretary some yards away sitting at a desk typing. She wears glasses and is very typically a secretary.

Mr Chigger

Oh yes, thanks. Thanks a lot.

Bishop

'Oh Mr Belpit' - not at all - 'your legs are so swollen'.

Bishop

He continues rehearsing as Mr Chigger moves over to the secretary

Mr Chigger

Excuse me, I saw your advertisement for flying lessons and I'd like to make an application.

Secretary

Appointment?

Mr Chigger

Yes, yes.

Secretary

Certainly. Would you come this way, please.

She gets up, clutching a file and trips off in a typical efficient secretary's walk. Mr Chigger follows. Cut to a river. She goes straight in without looking to right or left, as if she does this routine as a matter of course. Mr Chigger follows. Halfway across the river they pass a couple of business executives hurrying in the opposite direction.

Secretary

Morning, Mr Jones, Mr Barnes.

Cut to a forest. They come past towards camera, passing a tea trolley on the way with a tea lady and a couple of men around it.

Secretary

Morning Mrs Wills.

Mrs Wills

Morning, luv.

Arty shot. Skyline of a short sharp hill, as in Bergman's 'Seventh Seal'. They come in frame right and up and over, passing two men and exchanging 'Good mornings'. Cut to seashore. Tripping along, they pass another executive.

Executive

Take this to Marketing, would you.

They disappear into a cave. We hear footsteps and a heavy door opening.

Secretary's Voice

Just follow me.

Mr Chigger's Voice

Oh thank you.

Cut to a shopping street. Camera pans in close-up across road surface.

Secretary's Voice

Oh, be careful.

Mr Chigger's Voice

Yes, nearly tripped.

Secretary's Voice

Be there soon.

Mr Chigger's Voice

Good. It's a long way, isn't it?

Secretary's Voice

Oh, get hold of that - watch it.

Voice

Morning.

Secretary's Voice

Morning. Upstairs. Be careful, it's very steep. Almost there.

Camera reaches a GPO tent in middle of road.

Secretary

Morning.

Secretary

they emerge from the tent

Secretary

cut to interior office, another identical secretary at the desk

Secretary

In here, please.

Mr Chigger

Thank you.

Mr Chigger

he enters and first secretary trips off he approaches the second secretary

Mr Chigger

Hello, I saw your advertisement for flying lessons and I'd like to make an appointment.

Second Secretary

Well, Mr Anemone's on the phone at the moment, but I'm sure he won't mind if you go on in. Through here.

He goes through door. Mr Anemone is suspended by a wire about nine feet off the ground. He is on the telephone.

Mr Anemone

Ah, won't be a moment. Make yourself at home.

Mr Anemone

into phone

Mr Anemone

he throws receiver at telephone but misses

Mr Anemone

Missed. Now Mr er...

Mr Chigger

Chigger.

Mr Anemone

Mr Chigger. So, you want to learn to fly?

Mr Chigger

Yes.

Mr Anemone

Right, well, up on the table, arms out, fingers together, knees bent...

Mr Chigger

No, no, no.

Mr Anemone

very loudly

Mr Anemone

Mr Chigger gets on the table

Mr Anemone

Mr Chigger jumps and lands on the floor

Mr Anemone

Rotten. Rotten. You're no bloody use at all. You're an utter bloody wash-out. You make me sick, you weed!

Mr Chigger

Now look here...

Mr Anemone

All right, all right. I'll give you one more chance, get on the table...

Mr Chigger

Look, I came here to learn how to fly an aeroplane.

Mr Anemone

A what?

Mr Chigger

I came here to learn how to fly an aeroplane.

Mr Anemone

sarcasticaly

Mr Anemone

imitation posh accent

Mr Anemone

'Oh, oh, no more buttered scones for me, mater. I'm off to play the grand piano'. 'Pardon me while I fly my aeroplane.' Now get on the table!

Mr Chigger

Look. No one in the history of the world has ever been able to fly like that.

Mr Anemone

Oh, I suppose mater told you that while you were out riding. Well, if people can't fly what am I doing up here?

Mr Chigger

You're on a wire.

Mr Anemone

Oh, a wire. I'm on a wire, am I?

Mr Chigger

Of course you're on a bloody wire.

Mr Anemone

I am

Mr Anemone

not

Mr Anemone

on a wire. I am flying.

Mr Anemone

I am flying.

Mr Anemone

I'll show you whether I'm on a wire or not. Give me the 'oop.

Mr Chigger

What?

Mr Anemone

Oh, I don't suppose we know what an 'oop is. I suppose pater thought they were a bit common, except on the bleedin' croquet lawn.

Mr Chigger

Oh, a

Mr Chigger

hoop

Mr Chigger

.

Mr Anemone

'Oh an

Mr Anemone

hoop

Mr Anemone

taking hoop

Mr Anemone

he waves hoop over head and feet

Mr Chigger

Go on, right the way along.

Mr Anemone

All right, all right, all right.

Mr Anemone

he moves hoop all the way along himself allowing the wire to pass through obvious gap in hoop's circumference

Mr Anemone

. Now, where's the bleeding wire, then?

Mr Chigger

That hoop's got a hole in.

Mr Anemone

Oh Eton and Madgalene. The hoop has an hole in. Of course it's got a hole in, it wouldn't be a hoop otherwise, would it, mush!

Mr Chigger

No, there's a gap in the middle, there.

Mr Anemone

Oh, a gahp. A gahp in one's hhhhhoop. Pardon me, but I'm off to play the grand piano.

Mr Chigger

Look, I can see you're on a wire - look, there it is.

Mr Anemone

Look, I told you, you bastard, I'm not on a wire.

Mr Chigger

You are. There is.

Mr Anemone

There isn't.

CAPTION: 'TWO YEARS LATER'

Interior cockpit of airliner. Mr Chigger (pilot) and a second pilot sitting at controls.

Mr Chigger

Gosh, I am glad I'm a fully qualified arline pilot.

Cut to BALPA spokesman sitting at a desk. He is in Captain's uniform and has a name plate in front of him on the desk saying 'BALPA Spokesman'.

BALPA Man

The British Airline Pilots Association would like to point out that it takes a chap six years to become a fully qualified airline pilot, and not two.

CAPTION: 'FOUR YEARS LATER THAN THE LAST CAPTION'

Interior cockpit. For three seconds. Then cut back to BALPA spokesman.

BALPA Man

Thank you. I didn't want to seem a bit of an old fusspot just now you know, but it's just as easy to get these things right as they are easily found in the BALPA handbook. Oh, one other thing, in the Sherlock Holmes last week Tommy Cooper told a joke about a charter flight, omitting to point out that one must be a member of any organization that charters a plane for at least six months beforehand, before being able to take advantage of it. Did rather spoil the joke for me, I'm afraid.

BALPA Man

phone ring

BALPA Man

puts phone down

BALPA Man

My wife just reminded me that on a recent 'High Chapparal' Kathy Kirby was singing glibly about 'Fly me to the Stars' when of course there are no scheduled flights of this kind, or even chartered, available to the general public at the present moment, although of course, when they are BALPA will be in the vanguard. Or the Trident. Little joke for the chaps up at BALPA House. And one other small point. Why is it that these new lurex dancing tights go baggy at the knees after only a couple of evenings' fun? Bring back the old canvas ones I say. It is incredible, isn't it, that in these days when man can walk on the moon and work out the most complicated hire purchase agreements, I still get these terrible headaches. Well . .. I seem to have wandered a bit, but still, no harm done. Jolly good luck.

Back in the cockpit of the airliner. The two pilots sit there. Atmospheric noise of a big airliner in flight. Suddenly there is a banging on the door at the back of the cockpit.

Zanie

off-screen

Zanie

the two pilots exchange a puzzled look, then shrug and go back to flying; suddenly another series of bangs on door

Zanie

they exchange another look; pause; a heavier bang on the door

Zanie

a crash as he attempts to force it; another crash and the door flies open; Mr Zanie enters

Zanie

suddenly realizing where he is

Zanie

Oh my God. Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I thought this was the bally toilet.

Second Pilot

This is the control cabin.

Zanie

Oh I know that. I'm a flying man, you know... oh yes... Bally stupid mistake...

A pause. Zanie remains standing at the back of cockpit. The pilots go on as if he is not there.

Second Pilot

Cloud's heavy ... What's the reading?

Mr Chigger

4.8... Steady.

Zanie

If they had all those dials in the toilet... there wouldn't be room for anything else, would there.

Zanie

another nervous laugh; not the slightest reaction from the pilots

Mr Chigger

into intercom

Mr Chigger

Hello, Geneva this is Roger Five-O ... What is your cloud reading? Hello, Geneva...

Zanie

I wouldn't fancy flying one of those sitting on the toilet... I mean it'd take the glamour out of being a pilot, wouldn't it, ha ha, flying around the world sitting on a toilet.

Radio Voice

Geneva here. 4.9 ... Heavy... Over.

Mr Chigger

Serious?

Second Pilot

No, not if it keeps at that level, no.

Zanie

Mind you, if you did fly it from the toilet it would leave a lot more space up here, wouldn't it.

Zanie

finally he realizes his attempt at small talk is not working

Zanie

he pushes lever down on the door which opens directly out of the plane

Zanie

he gives it a shoulder charge and flies straight out of the plane

Zanie

Aaaaaaaaaarrrggghhhhhh!

Plane noise overhead. Continue scream. Outside of a gent's lavatory, there is a big pile of straw. Pause, then Zanie drops onto the straw. He looks up at gent's sign.

Zanie

Bally piece of luck...

He brushes himself down and goes into gents. Cut back to cockpit. A hostess enters from the passenger cabin.

Second Pilot

Oh hello. Everything all right at the back?

Hostess

Yes, they're as quiet as dormice.

Second Pilot

Dormice?

Door opens and a man in a neat suit enters. From beneath his jacket he produces a revolver with silencer attachment. He points it at the pilots.

Gunman

All right, don't anybody move ... except to control the aeroplane ... you can move a little to do that.

Hostess

Can I move?

Gunman

Yes, yes, yes. You can move a little bit. Yes. Sorry, I didn't mean to be so dogmatic when I came in. Obviously you can all move a little within reason. There are certain involuntary muscular movements which no amount of self-control can prevent. And obviously any assertion of authority on my part, I've got to take that into account.

The ensuing conversation is perfectly calm and friendly.

Second Pilot

Right. I mean one couldn't for example, stop one's insides from moving.

Gunman

No, no. Good point, good point.

Second Pilot

And the very fact that the plane is continuously vibrating means that we're all moving to a certain extent.

Gunman

And we're all moving our lips, aren't we?

Pilots

Yes, yes.

Second Pilot

Absolutely.

Gunman

No, the gist of my meaning was that sudden... er...

Hostess

Exaggerated movements ...

Gunman

Exaggerated

Gunman

violent

Gunman

movements... are... are out.

Second Pilot

Well, that's the great thing about these modern airliners. I mean, I can keep this plane flying with only the smallest movement and Pancho here doesn't have to move at all.

Gunman

Oh, that's marvellous.

Hostess

Hostess

And I don't really need to move either ... unless I get an itch or something...

They all laugh.

Gunman

Well that's wonderful ... 60% success, eh?

Gunman

they laugh again

Gunman

Anyway, bearing all that in mind, will you fly this plane to Luton, please?

Second Pilot

Well, this is a scheduled flight to Cuba.

Gunman

I know, I know, that's rather why I came in here with that point about nobody moving.

First Pilot

Within reason.

Gunman

Within reason - yes. I... er ... er... you know, I want you to fly this plane to Luton ... please.

Second Pilot

Right, well I'd better turn the plane round then. Stand by emergency systems.

Gunman

Look I don't want to cause any trouble.,

Second Pilot

No, no, we'll manage, we'll manage.

Gunman

I mean, near Luton will do, you know. Harpenden, do you go near Harpenden?

First Pilot

It's on the flight path.

Gunman

Okay, well, drop me off there. I'll get a bus to Luton. It's only twenty-five minutes.

Hostess

You can be in Luton by lunchtime.

Gunman

Oh, well that's smashing.

First Pilot

Hang on! There's no airport at Harpenden.

Gunman

Oh well, look, forget it. Forget it. I'll come to Cuba, and get a flight back to Luton from there.

Second Pilot

Well, we could lend you a parachute.

Gunman

No, no, no, no, no. I wouldn't dream of it... wouldn't dream of it... dirtying a nice, clean parachute.

First Pilot

I know - I know. There's a bale of hay outside Basingstoke. We could throw you out.

Gunman

Well, if it's all right.

All

Sure, yeah.

Gunman

Not any trouble?

Pilots

None at all.

Gunman

That's marvellous. Thank you very much. Sorry to come barging in.

Hostess

Bye-bye.

Gunman

Thank you. Bye.

Pilots

Bye.

They open the door and throw him out.

Gunman

Gunman

Thank you!

Cut to haystack in a field

not the same bale of hay that was landed on before

. Aeroplane noise overhead. The gunman suddenly falls into the haystack. He gets up, brushes himself down, hops over a fence, and reaches a road. He puts his hand out and a bus stops. It has 'Straight to Luton' written on it. He gets in. Conductor is just about to take his fare, when an evil-looking man with a gun jumps up and points gun at conductor.

Hijacker

Take this bus to Cuba.

Bus moving away from camera. The destination board changes to 'Straight to Cuba'. The bus does a speedy u-turn, and goes out of frame. Camera pans away revealing a rather rocky highland landscape. As camera pans across country we hear inspiring Scottish music.

Voice Over

From these glens and scars, the sound of the coot and the moorhen is seldom absent. Nature sits in stern mastery over these rocks and crags. The rush of the mountain stream, the bleat of the sheep, and the broad, clear Highland skies, reflected in turn and loch ...

at this moment we pick up a highland gentleman in kilt and tam o'shanter clutching a knobkerry in one hand and a letter in the other

Cut to crofter's cottage. McTeagle sits at the window writing. We zoom in very slowly on him us he writes.

Voice Over

But it was with more simple, homespun verses that McTeagle's unique style first flowered.

McTeagle

McTeagle

If you could see your way to lending me sixpence. I could at least buy a newspaper. That's not much to ask anyone.

Voice Over

One woman who remembers McTeagle as a young friend - Lassie O'Shen.

Cut to Lassie O'Shen - a young sweet innocent Scots girl - she is valiantly trying to fend off the sexual advances of the sound man. Two other members of the crew pull him out of shot.

Lassie

Mr MeTeagle wrote me two poems, between the months of January and April 1969...

Interviewer

Could you read us one?

Lassie

Och, I dinna like to... they were kinda personal... but I will.

Lassie

she has immediately a piece of paper in her hand from which she reads

Lassie

'To Ma Own beloved Lassie. A poem on her 17th Birthday. Lend us a couple of bob till Thursday. I'm absolutely skint. But I'm expecting a postal order and I can pay you back as soon as it comes. Love Ewan.'

There is a pause. She looks up.

CAPTION: 'ST JOHN LIMBO -- POETRY EXPERT'

Since then, McTeagle has developed and widened his literary scope. Three years ago he concerned himself with quite small sums - quick bits of ready cash: sixpences, shillings, but more recently he has turned his extraordinary literary perception to much larger sums - fifteen shillings, £4.12.6 ... even nine guineas ... But there is still nothing to match the huge sweep ... the majestic power of what is surely his greatest work: 'Can I have fifty pounds to mend the shed?'.

Pan across studio to a stark poetry-reading set. A single light falls on an Ian McKellan figure in black leotard standing gazing dramatically into space. Camera crabs across studio until it is right underneath him. He speaks the lines with great intensity.

Ian

Can I have fifty pounds to mend the shed?

Ian

I'm right on my uppers.

Ian

I can pay you back

Ian

When this postal order comes from Australia.

Ian

Honestly.

Ian

Hope the bladder trouble's getting better.

Ian

Love, Ewan.

Cut to remote Scottish landscape, craggy and windtorn and desolate. In stark chiaroscuro against the sky we see McTeagle standing beside a lonely pillar box, writing postcards. The sun setting behind him.

Limbo

Limbo

There seems to be no end to McTeagle's poetic invention. 'My new cheque book hasn't arrived' was followed up by the brilliantly allegorical 'What's twenty quid to the bloody Midland Bank?' and more recently his prizewinning poem to the Arts Council: 'Can you lend me one thousand quid?'

Cut to David Mercer figure in his study at a desk.

CAPTION: 'A VERY GOOD PLAYWRIGHT'

I think what McTeagle's pottery... er... poetry is doing is

Cut to long shot of McTeagle walking through countryside.

McTeagle

continues muttering indistinctly

He walks out of shot past a glen containing several stuffed animals, one of which explodes. A highland spokesman stands up into shot.

SUERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'A HIGHLAND SPOKESMAN'

Highlander

As a Highlander I would like to complain about some inaccuracies in the preceding film about the poet Ewan McTeagle. Although his name was quite clearly given as McTeagle, he was throughout wearing the Cameron tartan. Also I would like to point out that the BALPA spokesman who complained about aeronautical inaccuracies was himself wearing a captain's hat, whereas he only had lieutenant's stripes on the sleeves of his jacket. Also, in the Inverness pantomime last Christmas, the part of Puss in Boots was played by a native of New Guinea with a plate in her lip, so that every time Dick Whittington gave her a French kiss, he got the back of his throat scraped.

A doctor's head appears out from under the kilt.

Doctor

Look, would you mind going away, I'm trying to examine this man.

Doctor

he goes back under the kilt; a slight pause; he re-emerges

Animation leads to a living room. Doorbell rings. Lady opens the door, a milkman stands there.

Milkman

Pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake baker's man. Good morning, madam, I'm a psychiatrist.

Lady

You look like a milkman to me.

Milkman

Good.

Milkman

as a milkman... you spotted that - well done.

Lady

Go away.

Milkman

Now then, madam. I'm going to show you three numbers, and I want you to tell me if you see any similarity between them.

Milkman

holds up a card saying '3' three times

Lady

They're all number three.

Milkman

No. Try again.

Milkman

No. They're

Milkman

Right. Now. I'm going to say a word, and I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head. How many pints do you want?

Lady

narrowing her eyes, suspecting a trap

Lady

Er, three?

Milkman

Yogurt?

Lady

Er... no.

Milkman

Cream?

Lady

No.

Milkman

Eggs?

Milkman

does some adding up and whistling

Milkman

Right. Well, you're quite clearly suffering from a repressive libido complex, probably the product of an unhappy childhood, coupled with acute insecurity in adolescence, which has resulted in an attenuation of the libido complex.

Lady

You

Lady

are

Lady

a bloody milkman.

Milkman

Don't you shout at me, madam, don't come that tone. Now then, I must ask you to accompany me down to the dairy and do some aptitude tests.

Lady

I've got better things to do than come down to the dairy!

Milkman

Mrs Ratbag, if you don't mind me saying so, you are badly in need of an expensive course of psychiatric treatment. Now I'm not going to say a trip to our dairy will cure you, but it will give hundreds of lower-paid workers a good laugh.

Lady

All right... but how am I going to get home?

Milkman

I'll run you there and back on my psychiatrist's float.

Lady

All right.

The milkman and lady walk down her garden path. As they go out of the garden gate there's a cat on the garden wall.

CAPTION and arrow: 'A CAT'

The cat explodes. The milkman motions her towards the milk float with a large signboard which reads: 'Psychiatrist's Dairy Ltd'. Just as they are getting in, she points to all the files in the back in milk crates.

Lady

What are those?

Milkman

They're case histories.

Milkman

drives off; the van speaker announces: 'Psychiatrists! Psychiatrists!' The doctor from the Scots sketch hails him

Milkman

Yes, sir?

Doctor

Ah, good morning. I'm afraid our regular psychiatrist hasn't come round this morning ... and I've got an ego block which is in turn making my wife over-assertive and getting us both into a state of depressive neurosis.

Milkman

Oh, I see, sir. Who's your regular, sir?

Doctor

Jersey Cream Psychiatrists.

Milkman

Oh yes, I know them.

Milkman

puts down crate and gets out note pad

Milkman

Right, well, er, what's your job, then?

Doctor

I'm a doctor.

Doctor

Two pints of cream.

Milkman

Right... well I should definitely say you're suffering from a severe personality disorder, sir, sublimating itself in a lactic obsession which could get worse depending on how much money you've got.

Doctor

Yes, yes, I see. And a pot of yogurt, please.

Cut to a psychiatrist called Dr Cream in his office.

Dr Cream

I would like to take this opportunity of complaining about the way in which these shows are continually portraying psychiatrists who make pat diagnoses of patients' problems without first obtaining their full medical history.

Cut back to milkman with doctor.

Milkman

Milkman

Mind you, that's just a pat diagnosis made without first obtaining your full medical history.

Man

I feel the time has come to complain about people who make rash complaints without first making sure that those complaints are justified.

Cut to Dr Cream.

Dr Cream

Are you referring to me?

Cut back to man.

Man

Not necessarily, however, I would like to point out that the BALPA spokesman was wearing the British Psychiatric Association Dinner Dance Club cuff-links.

Dr Cream

Oh yes, I noticed that too.

Cut to BALPA man.

BALPA Man

These are not British Psychiatric Association Dinner Dance Club cuff-links.

Cut to man.

Man

Sorry.

BALPA Man

They are in fact British Sugar Corporation Gilbert-and-Sullivan Society cuff-links. It is in fact a sort of in-joke with us lads here at BALPA. I think the last speaker should have checked his facts before making his own rash complaint.

Dr Cream

Yes, that'll teach him.

BALPA Man

However, I would just like to add a complaint about shows that have too many complaints in them as they get very tedious for the average viewer.

Cut to another man.

Another Man

I'd like to complain about people who hold things up by complaining about people complaining. It's about time something was done about it.

Another Man

the sixteen-ton weight falls on him

Cut to a street with milkman and lady riding on milk float. It comes to a halt. They get out, milkman hails a milkmaid with yoke and two pails.

Milkman

Nurse! Would you take Mrs Pim to see Dr Cream, please.

Milkmaid

Certainly, doctor. Walk this way, please.

Lady

Oh, if I could walk that way I...

Milkman and Milkmaid

Sssssh!

The milkmaid leads Mrs Pim into a building, and into a psychiatrist's office. Dr Cream is in a chair.

Milkmaid

Mrs Pim to see you, Dr Cream.

Dr Cream

Ah yes. I just want another five minutes with Audrey. Could you show Mrs Pim into the waiting room, please.

Milkmaid

Yes, doctor.

As milkmaid and Mrs Pim leave the room we see that there is a cow on the couch.

Dr Cream

Right, Audrey. When did you first start thinking you were a cow?

Milkmaid and Mrs Pim emerge from building through a herd of cows and we then have a montage of shots of them walking through countryside as in opening sequence of flying lesson sketch at beginning of show. They pass a tea trolley woman, the bishop learning his script...

Hello, and welcome to the show. Without more ado, the first item is a sketch about architects, called The Architects Sketch...The Architects Sketch...The Architects Sketch...

Gumbys

ad the sketch fails to start they point up at a nearby building

The camera pans to a window in the building. Cut to the office inside, where a board meeting is taking place. The Chairman is Mr Tid.

Gentlemen, we have two basic suggestions for the design of this...

Mr Tid

he is distracted by the two Gumbys still shouting

Mr Tid

Mr Tid

Mr Wiggin comes in

Mr Tid

Ah, yes - it's Mr Wiggin of Ironside and Malone.

Wiggin walks to the table on which his model stand.

Mr Wiggin

Good morning, gentlemen. This is a twelwe-storey block combining classical neo-Georgian features with the efficiency of modern techniques. The tenants arrive in the entrance hall here, and are carried along the corridor on a conveyor belt in extreme comfort and past murals depicting Mediterranean scenes, towards the rotating knives. The last twenty feet of the corridor are heavily soundproofed. The blood pours down these chutes and the mangled flesh slurps into these...

First City Gent

Excuse me....

Mr Wiggin

Hm?

First City Gent

Did you say knives?

Mr Wiggin

Rotating knives, yes.

Second City Gent

Are you proposing to slaughter our tenants?

Mr Wiggin

Does that not fit in with your plans?

First City Gent

No, it does not. We asked for a simple block of flats.

Mr Wiggin

Oh, I see. I hadn't correctly divined your attitude towards your tenants. You see I mainly design slaughter houses. Yes, pity. Mind you, this is a real beaut. I mean, none of your blood caked on the walls and flesh flying out of the windows, inconveniencing the passers-by with this one. I mean, my life has been building up to this.

Second City Gent

Yes, and well done, but we want a block of flats.

Mr Wiggin

May I ask you to reconsider. I mean, you wouldn't regret it. Think of the tourist trade.

First City Gent

No, no, it's just that we wanted a block of flats, not an abattoir.

Mr Wiggin

Yes, well, of course, this is just the sort blinkered philistine pig ignorance I've come to expect from you non-creative garbage. You sit there on your loathsome, spotty behinds squeezing blackheads, not caring a tinker's cuss about the struggling artist.

Mr Wiggin

shouting

Mr Wiggin

You excrement! You lousy hypocritical whining toadies with your lousy colour TV sets and your Tony Jacklin golf clubs and your bleeding masonic handshakes! You wouldn't let me join, would you, you blackballing bastards. Well I wouldn't become a freemason now if you went down on your lousy, stinking, purulent knees and begged me.

Second City Gent

Well, we're sorry you feel like that but we, er, did want a block of flats. Nice though the abattoir is.

Mr Wiggin

Oh

Mr Wiggin

blows raspberry

Mr Wiggin

the abattoir, that's not important. But if any of you could put in a word for me I'd love to be a freemason. Freemasonry opens doors. I mean, I was...I was a bit on edge just now, but if I were a mason I'd sit at the back and not get in anyone's way.

In amongst the throng four city gents are leaping along with their trousers round their ankles. They are wearing bowler hats and pinstripes. Another city street or another part of the same street. Two city gents, with trousers rolled up to the knee, approach each other and go into the most extraordinary handshake which involves rolling on the floor etc.

Second Voice Over

Having once identified a mason immediate steps must be taken to isolate him from the general public. Having accomplished that it is now possible to cure him of these unfortunate masonic tendencies through the use of behavioural psychotherapy.

he open the drawer of the filing cabinet and takes out a shabby old sports jacket; he feels in the pocket and pulls out a crumbled dog-eared piece of paper then puts the coat back and shuts the filing cabinet

Devious

...here we are. It states quite clearly that no claim you make will be paid.

Vicar

Oh dear.

Devious

You see, you unfortunately plumped for our 'Neverpay' policy, which, you know, if you never claim is very worthwhile...but you had to claim, and, well, there it is.

Vicar

Oh dear, oh dear.

Devious

Still, never mind - could be worse. How's the nude lady?

Vicar

Oh, she's fine.

Vicar

'DIRECTED BY PREBENDARY "CHOPPER" HARRIS'

Exterior beautiful English church. Birds singing, a hymn being sung. Suddenly, sound of a high-powered car roaring towards the church. Screech of tires as a huge open-top American car screeches to a halt outside the church. The bishop leaps out. Behind him (as throughout the film) are his four henchmen... vicars with dark glasses. They wear clerical suits and dog collars. They leap out of their car and race up the drive towards the church. As they do so the hymn is heard to come to an end. Sound of people sitting down.

Cut to interior of church. Vicar climbing up into pulpit. Cut back to exterior. The bishop and his vicars racing through the doors. Interior of church. Shot of vicar in pulpit.

Vicar

I take as my text for today...

Cut to bishop and vicars at doorway.

Bishop

The text, vic! Don't say the text!

Cut back to vicar.

Vicar

Leviticus 3-14. . .

The pulpit explodes. Vicar disappears in smoke, flying up into the air. Cut to close-up of the bishop. Behind him there is smoke and people rushing about. Sound of people scrambling over pews in panic etc.

Bishop

We was too late. The Reverend Grundy bit the ceiling.

The end of the bishop's crook suddenly starts flashing. He lifts the flashing end off and it stops. Using it like a telephone receiver, he speaks into the staff.

Bishop

Hello? ... What?... We'll be right over!

Still of another church exterior. Crash zoom in on door. Cut to interior. A baptism party round the font. An innocent vicar is just testing the water. Pan across to the parents - a couple of shifty crooks - and two godmothers, obviously all-in wrestlers in drag (cauliflower ears etc.). As the vicar takes the baby it starts to tick loudly.

Vicar

And it is for this reason that the Christian Church lays upon you, the godparents, the obligation of seeing this child is brought up in the Christian faith. Therefore, I name this child...

Cut to door of church. The bishop and vicars rush in.

Bishop

Don't say the kid's name, vic!

Vicar

Francesco Luigi...

Explosion. Cut to close-up of bishop. Smoke and panic as before.

Bishop

We was too late... The Rev. Neuk saw the light.

Whip pan to interior of yet another church. A wedding. Bride and groom standing in front of a vicar. Cut to door of church. The bishop and vicars burst in.

Bishop

The ring, vic Don't touch the ring! Hey vic!

Cut to vicar taking the ring out of the bible. The ring is attached to a piece of string. A sixteen-ton weight falls on top of them with a mighty crunch - the camera shakes as it hits the floor.

Cut to two bell ringers. One pulls his rope, and the other rises off the floor, hanged by the neck. The bishop arrives, just too late.

Cut to another vicar at graveside.

Vicar

... dust to dust, ashes to ashes.

He sprinkles dust on the grave. A huge prop cannon rises up out of the grave until its mighty barrel (twelve inches wide) is pointing right in the vicar's face. He does not notice. Sound of car screeching to a halt. We pan away from grave to reveal the bishop leaping out of the car. Sound of an almighty blast from the cannon. The bishop gets back into the car immediately and turns it round.

Cut to a street. Outside a cigarette shop the four clerics lounge against a wall. The bishop walks out rolling his own. Suddenly he stops. Close-up. He looks up as he hears a faint cry. Camera swings round and up - enormous zoom to high window in huge, drab city office block, where a vicar is looking out.

Vicar

Help ... help... help... help... help... help...

Cut back to the bishop breaking into a run, throwing his cigarette into the gutter. Peter Gunn music. Hand-held shots of the bishop and the four vicars running through crowded streets. He reaches the office block, rushes in. Interior: a stair well. Right at the bottom we see the bishop and the vicars. Close-up hand-held shot of bishop running up stairs. Shadows running up the stair well. The bishop arrives on the top landing. Door of office. The bishop tries the door. It won't open. One vicar goes rigid. The other three take hold of him and use him as a battering ram and go straight through the balsa wood door first time.

Bishop

OK, Devious, don't move!

'The Bishop' titles again.

Cut to interior of cinema. A couple holding hands. Bishop film titles start up again exactly as before. After a couple of seconds of titles we cut to an old couple sitting in the back row of the cinema facing camera. The sound of the bishop's titles continues. The light from the projector is streaming out above their heads.

Mr Potter

This is where we came in.

Mrs Potter

Yes.

Cut immediately to the front of the cinema. A working-class lounge is arranged on the pavement. There are no walls, just the furnishings: settee, two armchairs, sideboard, table, standard lamp, a tiled fireplace with ornaments on it. There is also a free-standing inside door. Mr and Mrs Potter come out of the cinema and go straight to their chairs and sit down. Passers-by have to skirt the living-room furniture.

Mrs Potter

settling into her chair

Mrs Potter

Oh, it's nice to be home.

Mr Potter

looking round

Mr Potter

Builders haven't been then.

Mrs Potter

No.

A trendy interviewer with hand mike comes into shot.

Interviewer

These two old people are typical of the housing problem facing Britain's aged.

Mrs Potter

Here! Don't you start doing a documentary on us, young man.

Interviewer

Oh please ...

Mrs Potter

No, you leave us alone!

Interviewer

Oh, just a little one about the appalling conditions under which you live.

Mrs Potter

No! Get out of our house! Go on!

Interviewer turns, motions to his cameraman and soundman and they all trail off miserably.

Cameraman

Oh all right. Come on, George, pick it up.

Mrs Potter

Why don't you do a documentary about the drug problem round in Walton Street?

Cut to the camera crew. They stop, turn and mutter 'a drug problem!' and they dash off.

Mrs Potter

Oh, I'll go and have a bath.

She goes to the free-standing door and opens it. Beyond it we see the furnishings of a bathroom. In the bath is Alfred Lord Tennyson, fully clad. As she opens the door we hear him reciting:

Tennyson

The splendour fans on castle walls

Tennyson

And snowy summits old in story...

She slams the door.

Mrs Potter

'Ere, there's Alfred Lord Tennyson in the bathroom.

Mr Potter

Well, at least the poet's been installed, then.

Cut to an officious-looking man in Gas Board type uniform and peaked cap.

CAPTION: 'SALES MANAGER EAST MIDLANDS POET BOARD'

Cut to middle-class hall. The front doorbell rings. Housewife opens door to Gas Board type inspector with bicycle clips, rubber mac and cap and notebook. In the background we can hear muffled Wordsworth.

Voice

I wandered lonely as a cloud

Voice

That floats on high...

Inspector

Morning, madam, I've come to read your poet.

She

Oh yes, he's in the cupboard under the stairs.

Inspector

What is it, a Swinburne? Shelley?

She

No, it's a Wordsworth.

Inspector

Oh, bloody daffodils.

He opens the door of the cupboard under the stairs. Inside is Wordsworth crouching and reciting.

Wordsworth

A host of golden daffodils

Wordsworth

Beside the lake, beneath the trees

Wordsworth

Fluttering and dancing in the breeze

All this while the inspector is shining his torch over him and noting things on his clip board.

Wordsworth

Continuous as the stars that shine

Wordsworth

And twinkle in the Milky Way

Wordsworth

They stretch in...

The inspector shuts the door in the middle of this and we hear Wordsworth reading on, though muffled, throughout the remainder of the sketch.

Inspector

Right. Thank you, madam.

He makes as if to go, but she seems anxious to detain him and bars his way.

She

Oh, not at all. Thank

She

you

She

... It's a nice day, isn't it?

Inspector

Yes, yes, the weather situation is generally favourable. There's a ridge of high pressure centred over Ireland which is moving steadily eastward bringing cloudy weather to parts of the West Country, Wales and areas west of the Pennines. On tomorrow's chart ...

Inspector

he reaches up and pulls down a big weather chart from the wall

Inspector

the picture is much the same. With this occluded front bringing drier, warmer weather. Temperatures about average for the time of year. That's three degrees centigrade, forty-four degrees fahrenheit, so don't forget to wrap up well. That's all from me. Goodnight.

Cut to BBC world symbol.

Continuity Voice

Now on BBC television a choice of viewing. On BBC 2 - a discussion on censorship between Derek Hart, The Bishop of Woolwich and a nude man. And on BBC 1 - me telling you this. And now...

Sound of TV set bring switched off. The picture reduces to a spot and we pull out to see that it was actually on a TV set which has just been switched off by the housewife. She and the gas man are now sitting in her living room. He is perched awkwardly on the edge of the sofa. He holds a cup of tea with a cherry on a stick in it.

She

We don't want that, do we. Do you really want that cherry in your tea? Do you like doing this job?

Inspector

Well, it's a living, isn't it?

She

I mean, don't you get bored reading people's poets all day?

Inspector

Well, you know, sometimes ... yeah. Anyway, I think I'd better be going.

As he gets up she comes quickly to his side.

She

seductively

She

You've got a nice torch, haven't you?

Inspector

looking at it rather baffled

Inspector

Er, yeah, yeah, it er... it er ... it goes on and off.

He demonstrates.

She

drawing closer becoming breathy

She

How many volts is it?

Inspector

Er ... um... well, I'll have a look at the batteries.

Inspector

he starts unscrewing the end

She

Oh yes, yes.

Inspector

It's four and a half volts.

She

rubbing up against him

She

Mmmm. That's wonderful. Do you want another look at the poet?

Inspector

No, no, I must be off, really.

She

I've got Thomas Hardy in the bedroom. I'd like you to look at him.

Inspector

Ah well, I can't touch him. He's a novelist.

She

Oh, he keeps mumbling all night.

Inspector

Oh well, novelists do, you see.

She

dragging him onto the sofa

She

Oh forget him! What's your name, deary?

Inspector

Harness.

She

No, no! Your first name, silly!

Inspector

Wombat.

She

Oh, Wombat. Wombat Harness! Take me to the place where eternity knows no bounds, where the garden of love encloses us round. Oh Harness!

Inspector

All right, I'll have a quick look at yer Thomas Hardy.

Cut to studio discussion.

CAPTION: 'DEREK HART'

Derek

Nude man, what did you make of that?

Nude Man

Well, don't you see, that was exactly the kind of explicit sexual reference I'm objecting to. It's titillation for the sake of it. A deliberate attempt at cheap sensationalism. I don't care what the so-called avant-garde, left-wing, intellectual namby-pambies say... It is

Man

I quite like it.

Chemist

How about something a little more musky? This one's called Mimmo.

Not really, no. Have you anything a little more fishier?

Chemist

Chemist

Fish, fish, fish. A fishy requisite-t-t-t-t-t...

Chemist

Or bream?

Yes.

Chemist

No, we haven't got any of that... ah, I've got mackerel... or cod... or hake...

Man

You haven't got anything a little more halibutish?

Chemist

Er... parrot? What's that doing there? Or skate with just a hint of prawn? Or crab, tiger and almonds, very unusual.

Man

I really had my heart set on halibut.

Chemist

Well, sir, we had a fishy consignment in this morning, so I could nip down to the basement and see if I can come up trumps on this particular requisite-t-t-t-t-t. So it was halibut... or... ?

Man

Sea bass.

Chemist

Sea bass. Won't be a moment.

The man waits for a few seconds, starts becoming uncomfortable, looks at watch, hums.

The chemist turns his back. A shoplifter enters. There is two men inside a large mac. He has false arms behind his back a la Duke of Edinburgh. The man watches him. He strolls to the counter and then two arms come out of coat and grab things from counter taking them inside the coat. Then these two arms are joined by a third arm which is black. All these arms steal stuff. The man taps the chemist and points at shoplifter. Chemist watches and then blows whistle. They wait for a tick. Then the policeman runs into the shop.

Policeman

Right. Right! RIGHT! Now then! Now then! Your turn.

Chemist

Aren't you going to say 'What's all this then?'?

Policeman

Oh! Right, what's all this, then?

Chemist

This man has been shoplifting, officer.

Policeman

Animated titles.

Back to the snack bar.

Linkman

Well, those were the titles. And now for the first item this evening on the Menu - ha ha - the team have chosen as a little hors d'oeuvres an item - and I think we can be sure it won't be an ordinary item - in fact the team told me just before the show that anything could happen, and probably would - so let's have ... the item.

Cut to the word 'Blackmail' in letters four feet high, picked out in lightbulbs which flash on and off. Big showbiz music crashes in. Camera pulls back to reveal glittery showbiz set. A presenter in glittery showbiz jacket sits behind a glittery desk, with a telephone on it.

Presenter

Hello, good evening, and welcome to 'Blackmail'! And to start tonight's programme, we go to Preston in Lancashire, and Mrs Betty Teal!

Cut to a slightly blurred black and white photo of a housewife with her face blotted out by a black oblong.

Presenter

Hello, Mrs Teal!

Presenter

We'll be showing you more of that photograph later in the programme...unless we hear from Charles or Michael. And now it's time for our 'Stop the Film' spot!

SUPERIMPOSED FLASHING CAPTION: 'STOP THE FILM'

Presenter

The rules are very simple. We have taken a film which contains compromising scenes and unpleasant details, which could wreck a man's career. But, the victim may phone me at any point and stop the film. But remember the money increases as the film goes on. So the longer you leave it...the more you have to pay! So now, with the clock at £300 this week 'Stop the Film' visited Thames Ditton...

The following film is shot in murky 8mm. As the film progresses we have a £ sign with numerals in one corner which increase. Shot of a residental street in Thames Ditton (sic). Another section of a street with a figure in a Robin Hood hat and raincoat - in the distance on the far side of the road, so we can't really make him out. Cut to slightly closer shot of him about to cross the road. Cut to suburban house. The man is standing at the door pressing the bell and looking round rather furtively. Again shot from some distance and over a hedge. Cut back to studio. The presenter looking at a monitor and then at a phone. Back to the film: a woman opens the door. She wears a dressing gown over lingerie. A shaky zoom in to reveal her clothing. Wide shot of the house with door shut. Jump cut to shot obviously taken from a window in the house. Shaky zoom in on window. We can see in the window...both the man and woman enter the bedroom. He goes out of shot, taking his coat off. Cut back to studio.

Presenter

He's being very brave here...

Cut back to the film: even closer perhaps of window. A series of short jump cuts. She is undressing. She throws off her dressing gown. A jump and she's taking off her negligee. Underneath she wears black corsets. She produces a whip and seems to be beckoning to the man. Phone rings. Cut back to the studio. The presenter picks up the phone.

Presenter

Hello, sir, hello, yes. No sir, no, I'm sure you didn't. No, it's all right, sir, we don't morally censure, we just want the money....Yes, and here's the address to send it to:

He leaves the booth and goes through a door into a large room where a banquet is in progress. There are tables on three sides of a square and he joins the head table which faces as it were downstage. He sits beside other middle-aged and rather elderly men all of whom are the city of London ex-public school type. As he sits, the toastmaster standing behind speaks.

Cries of outrage. Chairman leaps to feet.

Sir William

Right, okay, meeting adjourned for ever.

He gets right up and walks away from the table to approving noises and applause. He walks to a door at the side of the studio set and goes through it. Exterior shot: a door opens and Sir William appears out of it into the fresh air. He suddenly halts.

Sir William

Good Lord. I'm on film. How did that happen?

He turns round and disappears into the building again. He reappears through door, crosses set and goes out through another door. He appears from the door into the fresh air and then stops.

Sir William

It's film again. What's going on?

He turns and disappears through the door again. Cut to him inside the building. He crosses to a window and looks out, then turns and says...

Sir William

Gentlemen! I have bad news. This room is surrounded by film.

Members

What? What?

Several members run to window and look out. Cut to film of them looking out of mindow. Cut to studio: the members run to a door and open it. Cut to film: of them appearing at the door hesitating and then closing door. Cut to studio: with increasing panic they run to the second door. Cut to film: they appear, hesitate, and go back inside.

How?

Sir William

We'll tunnel our way out.

Barnes

Good thinking, sir. I'll get the horse.

Sir William

Okay Captain, you detail three men, start digging and load them up with cutlery, and then we'll have a rota, we'll have two hours digging, two hours vaulting and then two hours sleeping, okay?

Barnes and others carry a vaulting horse into shot. The members start vaulting over it. Two Gestapo officers walk by.

Mr Cutler

All right, Medwin, let's see you get over that horse. Pick your feet up, Medwin. Come on, boy!

Hello. 'Ow are you? I'm fine. Welcome to a new half-hour chat show in which me, viz the man what's talking to you now, and Brooky - to wit my flat mate - and nothing else, I'd like to emphasize that - discuss current affairs issues of burning import.

Pull back to show Brooky.

Brooky

Have you heard the one about the three nuns in the nudist colony?

Praline

Shut up. Tonight, the population explosion.

Brooky

Apparently there were these three nuns...

Praline

Shut up. Come the year 1991, given the present rate of increase in the world's population, the Chinese will be three deep. Another thing...

Floor manager comes in.

Floor Manager

Sorry, loves, sorry, the show is too long this week and this scene's been cut.

Praline

Lord Hill's at the bottom of this.

Floor Manager

But if you can find a piano stool you can appear later on in the show on film.

Brooky

'Ow much?

Floor Manager

Oh, about ten bob each?

Praline

I wouldn't wipe me nose on it.

Brooky

'Ave you 'eard the one about these three nuns...

Praline

Shh. I can hear something. 'Ang about, we may still get in this show as a link.

Praline kneels and puts his ear to the floor. In the bottom section of the shot we see beneath the floor an animation of the unfortunate members of the Society for Putting Things on Top of Other Things being flushed along a pipe.

Brooky

That's clever. How do they do that?

Praline

Colour separation, you cotton head.

ANIMATION:

various adventures of the Society members.

Cut back to linkman. There is a loud argument going on in the café behind him.

Linkman

Well, they seem to be in another tight spot...

Linkman

to the argument

Linkman

to camera

Linkman

Well and now we move on to our, to our main course. Prawn salad...Prawn salad?

Oak-panelled door with notice on it saying 'Prawn Salad Ltd'. The butler pushes it open and shows man into living room. The room is fairly large, containing at one end opposite the door a big window, making the room look quite high up - although it should be stately rather than modern. In the middle of the room's back wall there is a large ornate mirror, over a mantelpiece filled with objects. To the right of this wall there is a large bookshelf filled with books, and in front of it there is a drinks trolley.

Butler

Well, if you'll just wait in here, sir, I'm sure Mr Thompson won't keep you waiting long.

Man

Fine. Thanks very much.

He picks up a magazine. The mirror behind him without warning falls off the wall and smashes to the ground. The butler returns, and looks at the man enquiringly.

Man

The mirror fell off the wall.

Butler

Sir?

Man

The mirror fell off... off the wall... it fell.

Butler

disbelieving but polite

Butler

I see. You'd better wait here. I'll get a cloth.

The butler just closes the door behind him and the bookcase detaches itself from the wall and comes sweeping down, bringing with it the drinks trolley. The butler opens the door.

Man

Ah, it ... it came off the wall.

Butler

Yes, sir?

Man

It just came right off the wall.

Butler

Really, sir.

Man

Yes, I ... I didn't touch it.

Butler

politely ironic

Butler

Of course not. It just fell off the wall.

Man

Yes. It just fell off the wall.

Butler

Don't move. I'll get help.

He goes.

Man

Yes - er, fell off the wall.

A maid enters.

Maid

Oh my God, what a mess. 'Ere, did you do this?

Man

No, no. I didn't do all this. It... it did it all.

Maid

Oh? Well... 'ere, hold this. I'll get started.

She hands him a dagger.

Man

Oh, it's jolly nice. What is it?

Maid

It's a Brazilian dagger. Ooops.

She trips, falls lethally on to the dagger he is holding. She collapses at his feet. There is blood on the dagger and his hand. He is looking down at her, when he becomes aware of a man in a green baize apron at the door, who is looking at him in horror.

Man

Er, she just fell on ... on to the dagger.

Green

soothingly

Green

Yes, of course she did, sir.

Man

Yes, just gave me the dagger and tripped, and went, 'Oops'.

Green starts backing round the room away from him, but humouring him.

Green

Yes sir, I understand.

Man

I mean, I didn't er...

Green

Oh no, no, of course not, sir, I understand.

Man

I mean she ... she just, er...

Green

Fell?

Man

Fell.

Green

backs off too far and falls backwards through the window

Green

Arrghh!

Man

to window

Man

I'm terribly sorry.

A policeman and the butler appear at the door.

Butler

That's him.

Policeman

Right, sir.

Man

Hello, officer. There seems to have been an accident. Well, several accidents actually.

Policeman

That's right, sir. Would you come this way, please.

Policeman

goes towards him

Policeman

clutches chest

Policeman

collapses

Butler

You swine. I'll get you for that.

He is about to move forward when a large portion of the ceiling collapses on him. He goes down, too.

Man

Er, I won't wait. I'll phone.

He moves off through door. Large crashing sounds. He comes downstairs into a stretch of hall leading to an outside door. As he comes suits of armour collapse, bookcase glass smashes, a grandfather clock tips over and smashes, pictures fall off walls. All this quite quickly in sequence as he passes in horror. He gets to the main door. We see his relief. He closes the main door behind him, slamming it: it's a country-house-type entrance. Cut to stock film of country house being blown up. Cut back to man looking in horror, with dust and rubble swirling around. He is holding the remains of the door.

Man

Sorry.

Pull wide. He is in a patch of rubble. The Society for Putting Things on Top of Other Things members walk by in their evening dress.

Members

I think we're really out this time. Yes. Jolly good. Now where's the school hall. I think it's over there. Come on. Sorry. Jolly good.

They go past the bishop in the field.

Bishop

singing

Bishop

Oh, Mr Belpit. Your legs are so swollen.

Sir William

Excuse me, is that the school hall?

Bishop

Um, I'm sorry, I don't know. I'm not in this one - I'm in next week's, I think.

Sir William

Oh, come on.

Bishop

Oh, Mr Belpit!...

They come to a school hall. A sign says 'Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, presented by the staff and pupils of the Dibley School for Boys'.

Sir William

Oh, here we are.

Sir William

they go in

Cut to linkman in cafeteria.

Linkman

Ah well, they seem to have linked that themselves, so there's no need for me to interrupt at all. So, ah, back to the school hall.

A school hall with a stage. Mr Praline and Brooky enter. Praline sits at piano and plays something very badly; Brooky turns the pages for him. Music ends. Unseen schoolmaster announcer:

Schoolmaster

'Seven Brides for Seven Brothers'.

Schoolmaster

slight applause

The curtain pans. Enter headmaster in mortar board and gown.

Headmaster

'Tis time the seven Smith brothers had brides. Fetch me Smith Major.

Enter Smith Major in short pants.

First Smith

Sir.

Headmaster

'Tis time you and your six brothers were married.

First Smith

Thank you, Headmaster.

Headmaster

Fetch me your six brothers, that the seven brothers may be together.

Smith Major rings handbell. Three boys enter and stand next to him.

Boys

Behold, the seven brothers.

Headmaster

Right, I'll see Watson, Wilkins, and Spratt in my study afterwards.

First Smith

has to be prompted, then declaims badly

First Smith

But where shall we find seven brides for seven brothers?

Second Smith

The Sabine School for Girls.

Third Smith

Yes, and it's the Annual Dance.

Headmaster

Fetch hither the seven brides for seven brothers.

Enter two schoolgirls.

Two Girls

Behold the seven brides.

Headmaster

Fetch hither the padre that the seven brides may marry the seven brothers.

Headmaster

nothing happens

Headmaster

Fetch hither the master on duty that the seven brides may marry the seven brothers.

Padre

entering

Padre

Sorry, I'm late, Headmaster - I've been wrestling with Plato.

Headmaster

What you do in your own time, Padre, is written on the wall in the vestry.

Padre

Right, do you four boys take these two girls to be your seven brides?

Boys

Yes, sir.

Padre

Right, go and do your prep.

The curtain comes across quickly.

Animation sketch links us to a butcher's shop. Harmless looking city gent enters.

Gent

Good morning, I'd care to purchase a chicken, please.

Butcher

Don't come here with that posh talk you nasty, stuck-up twit.

Gent

I beg your pardon?

Butcher

A chicken, sir. Certainly.

Gent

Thank you. And how much does that work out to per pound, my good fellow?

Butcher

Per pound, you slimy trollop, what kind of a ponce are you?

Gent

I'm sorry?

Butcher

4/6 a pound, sir, nice and ready for roasting.

Gent

I see, and I'd care to purchase some stuffing in addition, please.

Butcher

Use your own, you great poofy poonagger!

Gent

What?

Butcher

Ah, certainly sir, some stuffing.

Gent

Oh, thank you.

Butcher

'Oh, thank you' says the great queen like a la-di-dah poofta.

Butcher

That's all right, sir, call again.

Gent

Excuse me.

Butcher

What is it now, you great pillock?

Gent

Well, I can't help noticing that you insult me and then you're polite to me alternately.

Butcher

I'm terribly sorry to hear that, sir.

Gent

That's all right. It doesn't really matter.

Butcher

Tough titty if it did, you nasty spotted prancer.

Cut to the Grillomat in Paignton. The announcer is just handing back a cup and saucer to a waitress.

Linkman

Sorry, I asked for tea.

Linkman

she takes it grudgingly

Linkman

to camera

Linkman

last

Linkman

waitress hands him back his cup

Linkman

Now I did ask for tea.

Waitress

But you just said coffee.

Linkman

No, no, that was just my announcement, just a metaphor.

She shrugs and begins to move off. At the table just behind him we hear her complaining noisily in the background.

Linkman

We come...look would you mind keeping it down, please...we come as - as I said just now, to the coffee.

Waitress

Here, he said it again!

Linkman

Shut up!

Film of a boxer (John) in training, running along a country road. All this is shot in 'Man Alive' style: plenty of hand-held documentary work. Sound of boxer's feet on the leaves and heavy breathing.

Voice Over

This is Ken Clean-Air Systems, the great white hope of the British boxing world. After three fights - and only two convictions - his manager believes that Ken is now ready to face the giant American, Satellite Five.

Cut to manager being driven in Rolls.

SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'MR ENGLEBERT HUMPERDINCK - MANAGER'

Manager

The great thing about Ken is that he's almost totally stupid.

Cut back to Ken jogging, the early morning sun filtering through the trees.

Voice Over

Every morning, he jogs the forty-seven miles from his two-bedroomed, eight-bathroom, six-up-two-down, three-to-go-house in Reigate, to the Government's Pesticide Research Centre at Shoreham. Nobody knows why.

Cut to Ken's wife (a young married with her head in a scarf and curlers), hanging out the washing in a council estate.

CAPTION: 'MRS CLEAN-AIR SYSTEMS'

Mrs CAS

Basically Ken is a very gentle, home-loving person. I remember when one of his stick insects had a knee infection. He stayed up all night rubbing it with germoline and banging its head on the table.

Cut to Ken's mother - an old lady in a wheelchair. Hand-held big close-up against the sky.

CAPTION: 'MRS NELLIE AIR-VENT, MOTHER'

Mother

Oh he was such a pretty baby, always so kind and gentle. He was really considerate to his mother, and not at all the kind of person you'd expect to pulverize their opponent into a bloody mass of flesh and raw bone, spitting teeth and fragments of gum into a ring which had become one man's hell and Ken's glory.

The wheelchair moves away and we see that it is on top of a car. Cut to exterior of a semi-detached house. Night.

Voice Over

Every morning at his little three-room semi near Reading, Ken gets up at three o'dock

Voice Over

light goes on

Voice Over

and goes back to bed again because it's far too early.

Light goes out. Close-up alarm clock at 7.05. General shot of room, Ken coming out of bathroom pulling his track-suit on.

Voice Over

At seven o'clock Ken gets up, he has a quick shower, a rub-down, gets into his track-suit, and goes back to bed again.

Voice Over

shot of trainer running

Voice Over

At 7.50 every morning Ken's trainer runs the 13,000 miles from his two-room lean-to in Bangkok and gets him up.

General shot of room to show his trainer standing over the sleeping Ken. He holds a large mallet and a steel peg.

Trainer

I used to wake Ken up with a crowbar on the back of the head. But I recently found that this was too far from his brain and I wasn't getting through to him anymore. So I now wake him up with a steel peg driven into his skull with a mallet.

Cut to the empty kitchen, shot from ground level. The camera pans across to show plate of food under an upright chair, and then pans across the room to the kitchen cupboard; Mrs Clean-Air Systems at the sink.

Voice Over

For breakfast every day, Ken places a plate of liver and bacon under his chair, and locks himself in the cupboard.

Cut to gym. Manager standing beside ropes of the ring. Again a hand-held 'Man Alive' type interview, with camera noise and all.

Manager

Well, he's having a lot of mental difficulties with his breakfasts, but this is temperament, caused by a small particle of brain in his skull, and once we've removed that he'll be perfectly all right.

Close-up alarm clock. Hands at 8.30.

Voice Over

At 8.30 the real training begins.

Voice Over

General shot of room. Ken asleep in bed

Voice Over

The door bursts open but we don't stay to see what happens. We cut immediately to outside of the house. His trainer pushes Ken out. Trainer goes back into the house (obviously to Ken's wife). Cut to Ken jogging through town. Hand held. Ken finds his way blocked by a parked car. He stops and looks very puzzled, then instead of going round it turns and runs back the way he has come.

Voice Over

At 10.30 every morning Ken arrives at what he thinks is the gym. Sometimes it's a sweetshop, sometimes it's a private house. Today its a hospital.

Ken turns into the gates of a hospital. There is a slight pause, and a white-coated doctor arrives at the door and points right up the street.

Doctor

Urn, straight down there. Straight down there.

Ken follows his finger and looks very hard in that direction. When he is satisfied that Ken has understood where he is pointing, the doctor retires back inside. Ken turns and watches him as he does this, then turns and sets off in the opposite direction. Cut to a shot of a roadside diner.

Voice Over

For lunch Ken crouches down in the road and rubs gravel into his hair.

Voice Over

Pan down to roadside to reveal Ken just finishing rubbing gravel into his hair; he stands up and hops over a railing to a riverside where a bed stands

Voice Over

Ken hops into the bed

Voice Over

Trainer runs into shot, pauses by bedside and turns to camera. He has large plumber's bag.

Trainer

Hello. When Ken is in a really deep sleep like this one, the only way to wake him up is to saw his head off.

Cut to stock close-up of punchbag and glove smashing into it. Continual hitting and impact-bang-bang-bang-bang throughout.

Voice Over

What is he like in the ring, this human dynamo, this eighteen-stone bantam weight battering-ram? We asked his sparring partner and one-time childhood sweetheart, Maureen Spencer.

Cut to medium close-up of Maureen, very busty in boxing gear and sparring helmet.

Maureen

Well, I think that if Ken keeps his right up, gets in with the left jab and takes the fight to his man - well, he should go for a cut eye in the third and put Wilcox on the canvas by six.

She goes back to sparring and we see it is she who is hitting the punchbag. Remaining on her we hear the voice over.

Voice Over

Ken's opponent in Tuesday's fight is Petula Wilcox, the Birmingham girl who was a shorthand typist before turning pro in 1968.

Voice Over

Cut to typical teenage girl's bedside. Pin-ups of popstars on the walls. Teddy bears on the bed and gonks. Petula Wilcox is sitting up on the bed knitting.

Voice Over

She's keen on knitting and likes Cliff Richard records. How does she rate her chances against Ken?

Petula

Well, I'm a southpaw and I think this will confuse him, particularly with his brain problem.

Cut to the ring. Floodlight. The night of the big fight. Murmur of a huge crowd. Excitement, cigar smoke rising in front of the camera. Bustle of activity all around. In medium close-up the master of ceremonies walks out into the middle of the ring, and takes the microphone.

Master of Ceremonies

My lords, ladies and gedderbong... On my right, from the town of Reigate in the county of Kent, the heavyweight...

Master of Ceremonies

unintelligible

Master of Ceremonies

applause, cut to Ken's corner; Ken raises his arms above his head

Master of Ceremonies

and on my left! Miss Petula Wilcox.

SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: ROUND 1

For the first time we see Petula dance out into the middle of the ring, frail and lovely in a white muslin dress, with a bow in her hair and boxing gloves. The referee bring them together, cautions them and then they separate. The bell goes. As speeded-up as we can manage and with the same stupendous sound effects as for all-in cricket, Ken belts the hell out of Petula. While this goes on, we hear a few voice overs.

Colonel Type

I think boxing's a splendid sport - teaches you self-defense.

Critic

Obviously boxing must have its limits, but providing they're both perfectly fit I can see nothing wrong with one healthy man beating the living daylights out of a little schoolgirl.

Voice

It's quick and it's fun.

Boxing match is still in full swing as we cut away to the Grillomat snack bar. A dim light; the announcer has gone. There is only the waitress setting chairs on the tables, and cleaning. She looks up as the camera comes on her.

Waitress

Oh, no, he's gone. But he left a message. Jack! Where's that note that fellow left?

Jack

Oh, here you are.

Waitress

It says sorry, had to catch the last bus. Am on the 49b to Babbacombe.

Cut to the top of an open-top bus driving along.

Linkman

Oh, er, there you are. Hello. You got the note, jolly good. Well, um, that's all the items that we have for you this week and er, what a jolly nice lot of items too, eh? Um...well, the same team will be back with you again next week with another menu full of items. Um...I don't know if I shall be introducing the show next week as I understand my bits in this show have not been recieved quite as well as they might

Linkman

start to roll credits over this

Linkman

miserably

Linkman

they'll

Linkman

starting to cry

Linkman

Sorry. I do beg your pardon. I don't like these...displays of emotion...I wish it would say the end.

It says 'The End'.

Quiz show set-up. Two contestants either side, compère in the middle. On the back wall in large letters it says 'It's a Living'. Music plays brightly. Track quickly into compère, losing contestants, as he starts his quick spiel.

CAPTION: 'IT'S A LIVING'

Compère

Hello, good evening, and welcome to 'It's A Living'. The rules are very simple: each week we get a large fee; at the end of that week we get another large fee; if there's been no interruption at the end of the year we get a repeat fee which can be added on for tax purposes to the previous year or the following year if there's no new series. Every contestant, in addition to getting a large fee is entitled to three drinks at the BBC or if the show is over, seven drinks - unless he is an MP, in which case he can have seven drinks before the show, or a bishop only three drinks in toto. The winners will receive an additional fee, a prize which they can flog back and a special fee for a guest appearance on 'Late Night Line Up'. Well, those are the rules, that's the game, we'll be back again same time next week. Till then. Bye-bye.

Cut to BBC world symbol.

Voice Over

Well, it's five past nine and nearly time for six past nine. On BBC 2 now it'll shortly be six and a half minutes past nine. Later on this evening it'll be ten o'clock and at 10.30 we'll be joining BBC 2 in time for 10.33, and don't forget tomorrow when it'll be 9.20. Those of you who missed 8.45 on Friday will be able to see it again this Friday at a quarter to nine. Now here is a time check. It's six and a half minutes to the big green thing.

Second Voice Over

You're a loony.

Voice Over

I get so bored. I get so bloody bored.

ANIMATION:

for a minute or two strange things happen on animation until suddenly we find ourselves into the animated title sequence.

Cut to the announcer in a silly location, sitting at his desk as usual.

Announcer

You probably noticed that I didn't say 'and now for something completely different' just now. This is simply because I am unable to appear in the show this week.

Announcer

looks closely at script, puzzled

Announcer

Sorry to interrupt you.

Cut to a man holding his mouth open to show the camera his teeth.

Man

I'm terribly sorry to interrupt but my tooth's hurting, just around here.

Voice

Get off.

Man

Oh, sorry.

Cut to pompous moustached stockbroker type.

Nabarro

I'm not sorry to interrupt - I'll interrupt anything if it gets people looking in my direction - like at my old school where, by a coincidence, the annual prize giving is going on at this very moment.

There is a ripple effect, and a muted trumpet plays a corny segue sequence. We mix through to the trumpeter at a school prize giving. On the stage of the school hall there is a long table behind which are sitting several distinguished people. A bishop in a grey suit and purple stock and dog collar gets up.

Bishop

My Lord Mayor, Lady Mayoress, it gives me very great pleasure to return to my old school, to present the prizes in this centenary year. This school takes very justifiable pride in its fine record of... aaaaagh!

Hands pull him down behind the table. Fighting, punching, struggle, grunts etc. No reaction at all from the distinguished guests. The bishop's head reappears for a moment.

Bishop

... scholarship and sporting achievement in all... aaaagh!

He disappears again. More noises. Up comes another bishop dressed identically.

Second Bishop

I'm, I'm afraid there's been a mistake. The man who has been speaking to you is an impostor. He is not in fact the Bishop of East Anglia, but a man wanted by the police.

Second Bishop

I

Second Bishop

he puts the silver cup into a sack

Second Bishop

Next we come to the Fairfax Atkinson Trophy for outstanding achievement in the field of Applied Mathematics. Well, there was no-one this year who reached the required standard so it goes in my sack. And by an old rule of the school all the other silver trophies also go in my sack ... aaagh!

He is dragged down by an unseen hand. More sounds of fighting, noisier than before even. A Chinaman in Mao jacket and cap appears.

Chinaman

Velly solly for hold-up ... no ploblem now ... me are Bishop of East Anglia, now piesent plizes ... Eyes down for first plize ... The Fyffe-Chulmleigh Spoon for Latin Elegaics... 'goes to ... People's Republic of China! Aaaagh!

The Chinaman is dragged down beneath the table as were the others. Again sound of struggle, thumps etc. A plainclothes policeman stands up.

Detective

Good evening, everybody. My name's Bradshaw - Inspector Elizabeth Bradshaw, of the Special Branch Speech Day Squad, but I'd like you to think of me as the Bishop of East Anglia, and I'd like to present the first prize, the Grimwade Gynn Trophy to...

A shot. He leaps backwards. Sound of machine guns and exploding shells. Two men in army uniform with camouflage sticking out of tin helmets rush up to the table and exchange fire. They have a huge bazooka which they fire from time to time.

Soldier

appearing from beneath the table, shouting above the din of the battle

Soldier

explosion and smoke, debris over the stage

Soldier

explosion

Soldier

a wretched schoolboy appears on the stage keeping his head down

Soldier

he manages to get the cup but as he stands to shake hands he is shot

Soldier

Oh... bad luck! The next prize...

Mix through to a picture on a TV monitor and pull out from monitor to reveal a studio set as for a late-night discussion programme.

Interviewer

Mr L.F. Dibley's latest film 'if'.

Interviewer

he turns to Dibley

Interviewer

Mr Dibley, some people have drawn comparisons between your film, 'if', which ends with a gun battle at a public school, and Mr Lindsay Anderson's film, 'if', which ends with a gun battle at a public school.

Dibley

Oh yes, well, I mean, there were some people who said my film '2001 - A Space Odyssey', was similar to Stanley Kubrick's. I mean, that's the sort of petty critical niggling that's dogged my career. It makes me sick. I mean, as soon as I'd made 'Midnight Cowboy' with the vicar as Ratso Rizzo, John Schlesinger rushes out his version, and gets it premiered while mine's still at the chemist's.

Interviewer

Well, we have with us tonight one of your films, 'Rear Window', which was to become such a success for Alfred Hitchcock a few weeks later. Now this is a silent film, so perhaps you could talk us through it...

Cut to a dim, shaky 8mm shot of a window. It is open. After a few seconds a man appears and looks out. He then performs over-exaggerated horror and points, looking at camera. Then he disappears and then he reappears.

Dibley

Yes, well, let's see now ... there's the rear window. There's the man looking out of the window. He sees the murder. The murderer's come into the room to kill him, but he's outwitted him and he's all right. The End. I mean, Alfred Hitchcock, who's supposed to be so bloody wonderful, padded that out to one and a half hours ... lost all the tension ... just because he had bloody Grace Kelly he made £3 million more than I did. Mind you, at least she can act a bit, I could have done with her in 'Finian's Rainbow' ... The man from the off-licence was terrible ... a real failure that was - ten seconds of solid boredom.

Cut to shaky titles: Mr Dibley's 'Finian's Rainbow starring the man from the off-licence'. Cut to the man from the off-licence standing by a tennis-court. He wears a dress and appears to be trying to say something - he has forgotten his words. He does an unconvincing little dance.

CAPTION: 'THE END'

Dibley

Bloody terrible.

Interviewer

Mr L. F. Dibley's 'Finian's Rainbow'. And now over to me.

Interviewer

close-up of interviewer

Interviewer

Exclusively on the programme today we have the Foreign Secretary, who has just returned from the bitter fighting in the Gulf of Amman. He's going to tell us about canoeing.

On the bank of a river seen from the other side. There is a canoe on the bank a man in a pinstripe suit stands beside it.

SUPERIMPOSEN CAPTION: 'THE FOREIGN SECRETARY'

He gives a little cough and gets in. Two Arabs run in from other side of frame, lift up the canoe and throw it and the Foreign Secretary into the water. Cut back to the interviewer.

Interviewer

That gives you just some idea of what's going on out there. Today saw the long-awaited publication of the Portman Committee's Report on Industrial Reorganization...

CAPTION: 'SOMETHING SILLY'S GOING TO HAPPEN'

Interviewer

It's taken five years to prepare and it's bound to have an enormous impact on the future of industrial relations in this country. In the studio tonight Lord Porlman, Chairman of the Committee, Sir Charles Avery, Employers' Reorganization Council, and Ray Millichope, leader of the Allied Technicians' Union. And they're going to make a human pyramid.

Three men in shorts run on to accompaniment of tinkly music and form a pyramid As they complete it we cut to film of Vatican crowds and dub on enormous ovation.

Interviewer

Bra... vo. Now the President of the Board of Trade...

Cut back to the same river bank shot from across the river. The President of the Board of Trade in pinstripes is standing beside a hamper. He smiles and gets in, and lowers the lid. Once again two Arabs run in from either side and throw it in. All these sequences are speeded up.

Interviewer

Now here's the Vice-Chairman of ICI.

Cut back to same river bank. A head looking out of the hamper. It disappears as two Arabs run in and toss it in.

Interviewer

Well, so much for politics and the problems of Britain's industrial reorganization. Now we turn to the lighter subject of sport, and Reg Harris, the former world cycling sprint champion, talks to us about the psychological problems of big race preparation.

Interviewer

Reg and his bike are thrown in the river by the Arabs

Interviewer

two hampers thrown in river by four Arabs

Interviewer

Well, all good things must come to an end, and that's all for this week. But to close our programme, Dame Irene Stoat, who celebrates her eighty-fifth birthday this month, reads one of her most famous poems.

Cut to the river bank. An old lady is standing beside it, but this time on the bank of the river nearest the camera. On the other bank we see the Arabs run into shot, realize they've been foiled and leap up and down in anger.

Dame Irene

Who shall declare this good, that ill

Dame Irene

When good and ill so intertwine

Dame Irene

But to fulfil the vast design of an omniscient will.

Dame Irene

When seeming again but turns to loss

Dame Irene

When earthly treasure proves but dross

Dame Irene

And what seems lost but turns again

Dame Irene

To high eternal gain.

The Arabs run out of vision. Suddenly, from right beside the camera, with a bloodcurdling scream a Samurai warrior with drawn sword leaps upon her and hurls her backwards into the water. The warrior then strikes up a fierce heroic pose for the camera.

SUPERIMPOSE CAPTION: 'NEWHAVEN - LE HAVRE. GETAWAY TO THE CONTINENT'

Cut to a smart dinner party. There are two couples in evening dress at the table. Candles burning on the polished wood, a fire burning in the grate. Muted music and sophisticated lighting.

Hostess

We had the most marvelous holiday. It was absolutely fantastic.

Host

Absolutely wonderful.

Hostess

Michael, you tell them about it.

Host

No, darling, you tell them.

Hostess

You do it so much better.

The doorbell rings.

Host

Excuse me a moment.

The host goes and answers the door of the flat, which opens straight into the dining room. Standing at the door is a large grubby man carrying a tub on his shoulder. There are flies buzzing around him. He walks straight in.

Man

Dung, sir.

Host

What?

Man

We've got your dung.

Host

What dung?

Man

Your dung. Three hundredweight of heavy droppings. Where do you want it?

Man

he looks round for a likely place

Host

I didn't order any dung.

Man

Yes you did, sir. You ordered it through the Book of the Month Club.

Host

Book of the Month Club?

Man

That's right, sir. You get 'Gone with the Wind', 'Les Miserables' by Victor Hugo, 'The French Lieutenant's Woman' and with every third book you get dung.

Host

I didn't know that when I signed the form.

Man

Well, no, no. It wasn't on the form - they found it wasn't good for business. Anyway, we've got three hundredweight of dung in the van. Where do you want it?

Host

Well, I don't think we do. We've no garden.

Man

Well, it'll all fit in here - it's top-class excrement.

Host

You can't put it in here, we've having a dinner party!

Man

'Salright. I'll put it on the telly.

He brings it into the dining room. The guests ignore him.

Host

Darling... there's a man here with our Book of the Month Club dung.

Hostess

We've no room, dear.

Man

Well, how many rooms have you got, then?

Host

Well, there's only this room, the bedroom, a spare room.

Man

Oh well, I'll tell you what, move everything into the main bedroom, then you can use the spare room as a dung room.

The doorbell goes and there standing at the door which hasn't been closed is a gas board official with a dead Indian over his shoulders.

Host

Yes.

Gas Man

Dead Indian.

Host

What?

Gas Man

Have you recently bought a new cooker, sir?

Gas Man

Ah well, this is your free dead Indian, as advertised...

Host

I didn't see that in the adverts...

Gas Man

No, it's in the very small print, you see, sir, so as not to affect the sales.

Host

We've no room.

Man

That's all right - you can put the dead Indian in the spare room on top of the dung.

Dead Indian

Me ... heap dizzy.

Host

He's not dead!

Gas Man

Oh well, that's probably a faulty cooker.

The phone rings. The wife goes to answer it.

Man

Have you, er... you read and enjoyed 'The French Lieutenant's Woman', then?

Host

No.

Man

No... still, it's worth it for the dung, isn't it?

Hostess

Darling, it's the Milk Marketing Board. For every two cartons of single cream we get the M4 motorway.

Cut to host and hostess standing bewildered in the middle of a motorway. Beside them is a steaming pile of dung, and a dead Indian. They look round in amazement. A police car roars up to them and two policemen leap out.

Policeman

Are you Mr and Mrs P. Forbes of 7, the Studios, Elstree?

Policeman

Right, well, get in the car. We've won you in a police raffle.

Speeded up, they are bundled into the car. Cut to inspector.

Inspector

Yes! This couple is just one of the prizes in this year's Police Raffle. Other prizes include two years for breaking and entering, a crate of search warrants, a 'What's all this then?' T-shirt and a weekend for two with a skinhead of your own choice.

Animation sketch leading to a booth in a quite expensive looking coffee shop, Italian style. Nigel is sitting there. Timmy William comes in. He has just the faintest passing resemblance to David Frost.

Timmy

Nigel! Wonderful to see you, super, super, super. Am I a teeny bit late?

Nigel

A bit, an hour.

Timmy

Oh, super! Only Snowdon's been re-touching my profile and we can't upset the lovely Snowdon, can we?

Nigel

Gosh, no.

A man passes.

Timmy

gets up and clasps his hands

Timmy

sits down

Timmy

It's really lovely to have this little chat with you.

Nigel

Well, I...

Timmy

It is so nice to have this little talk about things. I heard a teeny rumourlette that you were married.

Nigel

Well, not quite, no. My wife's just died, actually.

Timmy

Oh dear.

Timmy

sees another man passing

Timmy

extends his arm

Timmy

Timmy

Well, perhaps we could do a tribute to her on the show.

Nigel

Well, no. I...

Timmy

I'll get Peter, William, Arthur, Alex, Joan, Ted, Scott, Will, John and Ray to fix it up. It is so nice having this little chat.

Nigel

Well, actually Timmy, I'm glad to get you on your own...

A reporter comes up to the table.

Timmy

You don't mind if Peter just sits in, do you?

Nigel

Well, actually...

Timmy

Only he's doing an article on me for the 'Mail'. He's such a lovely person.

Reporter

Hello.

Timmy

Peter, this is one of the nicest people in the world, Nigel Watt.

Timmy

Peter scribbles it down

Timmy

W-A-double T. That's right, yes.

Nigel

Well, actually, Timmy, the thing is, it's a bit private.

A writer comes to the table.

Timmy

Oh, you don't mind if Peter just sits in, do you? Only Peter's writing a book on me. Peter, you know Tony from the 'Mail', don't you?

Peter

Yes, we met in the Turkish bath yesterday.

Timmy

Super, super. Did it come up well in the writing yesterday?

Peter

Great, great, great.

Timmy

You took out the tummy references?

Timmy

makes fatness signs

Peter

Yes, I did.

Timmy

Super, super, super. Just to fill you in, this is Nigel Watt and we are having a little heart-to-heart. H-E-A-R-T. Smashing. Do go on, Nigel.

They both start writing.

Nigel

Well, well, the thing is, Timmy, um er...

Timmy is smiling and posing. Nigel stops and looks. There is a photographer, hovering.

Timmy

Do carry on, it's the 'TV Times', only they syndicate these photographs to America. Would you mind if we just er...

Timmy

grabs him by the hand and poses hearty friendship photo

Timmy

Super, super. One over here, I think, Bob. A little smile, please, smashing, smashing. Feel free, Bob, to circulate, won't you. Do go on, this is most interesting.

Nigel

Well, the thing is, Timmy, I'm a bit embarrassed.

Waiter

Waiter

Oh, Mr Willimas, it's so nice to see you. Will you sign this for my little daughter, please?

Timmy

Hello, Mario. Super, wonderful.

Timmy

Timmy

Just two lovely coffees, please.

Director comes in.

Director

Sorry, sorry, Timmy. Can we just go from where Mario comes in, we're getting bad sound, OK?

Timmy

It's German television. Isn't it exciting, Nigel? They're doing a prize-winning documentary on me.

We see a film camera and the whole crew gathered round.

Timmy

Timmy

Such a lovely waiter. Now, go on please, this is most interesting.

Nigel

Well ... er... as I was saying, Timmy, my wife's gone... gone.

Nigel

close-up on him

Nigel

I've got three children and I'm at my wits end. No job, no insurance, no money at all. I'm absolutely flat broke, I just don't know where to turn. I... I'm absolutely at the end of my tether. You're my only chance. Can you help me, please, Timmy?

He looks up, Timmy isn't there. Timmy comes bounding back.

Timmy

Sorry, I was on the phone to America. It's been super having this lovely little chat. We must do this again more often. Er... will you get the coffees? I'm afraid I must dash, I'm an hour late for the Israeli Embassy.

Timmy

there is a shot; Nigel slumps over the table, gun in his hand

Timmy

Er... did you get that shot all right, sound?

Sound Man

Sound Man

Yes, fine.

Timmy

It... it wasn't a bit too wicked, was it? I mean, it wasn't too cruel?

Tony and Peter

No, no, no. It was great.

Timmy

No, super... well, er... I think it shows I'm human, don't you?

Tony and Peter

Yes, great.

Timmy

Super, super. Well, the charabanc's here. Go on, everybody. Bye.

No, no, no - it's spelt Raymond Luxury Yach-t, but it's pronounced 'Throatwobbler Mangrove'.

You're a very silly man and I'm not going to interview you.

Raymond

Ah, anti-semitism!

Not at all. It's not even a proper nose.

First Man

Er, excuse me, I want to get married.

Registrar

I'm afraid I'm already married, sir.

First Man

Er, no, no. I just want to get married.

Registrar

I could get a divorce, I suppose, but it'll be a bit of a wrench.

First Man

Er, no, no. That wouldn't be necessary because...

Registrar

You see, would you come to my place or should I have to come to yours, because I've just got a big mortgage.

No, no, I want to get married

First Man

Yes. I want to get married very quickly.

Registrar

Suits me, sir. Suits me.

First Man

I don't want to marry you!

Registrar

There is such a thing as breach of promise, sir.

First Man

Look, I just want you to act as registrar and

First Man

me.

Registrar

I will marry you sir, but please make up your mind. Please

Registrar

don't

First Man

I'm sorry, but...

Look, I'm already engaged.

Cheering from the crowd. Cut back to studio.

Linkman

Linkman

Well, there's the first result and the Silly Party has held Leicester. What do you make of that, Norman?

Cut to Norman. He is very excited.

Norman

Well, this is largely as I predicted, except that the Silly Party won. I think this is largely due to the number of votes cast. Gerald?

Cut to Gerald standing by the 'swingometer' - a pivoted pointer on a wall chart.

Gerald

Well there's a swing here to the Silly Party...but how big a swing I'm not going to tell you.

Cut to George also standing by a swingometer.

George

Well, if I may...I think the interesting thing here is the big swing to the Silly Party and of course the very large swing back to the Sensible Party...and a tendency to wobble up and down in the middle because the screw's loose.

Cut to Alphonse.

Alphonse

No, I'm afraid I can't think of anything.

Cut to Eric.

Eric

I can't add anything to that. Colin?

Cut to Colin.

Colin

Can I butt in at this point and say this is in fact the very first time I've appeared on television.

Cut to linkman.

Linkman

No, no we haven't time, because we're just going straight over to Luton.

Cut to Luton Town Hall. There are sensible, silly and slightly silly candidates.

Here at Luton it's a three-cornered fight between Alan Jones - Sensible Party, in the middle, Tarquin Fin- tim- lim- bim- whin- bim- lim- bus- stop- F'tang- F'tang- Olè- Biscuitbarrel - Silly Party, and Kevin Phillips-Bong, the Slightly Silly candidate.

Voice Over

And so the Silly Party has taken Luton.

Linkman

A gain for the Silly Party at Luton. The first gain of the election, Norman?

Norman

Well this is a highly significant result. Luton, normally a very sensible constituency with a high proportion of people who aren't a bit silly, has gone completely ga-ga.

Linkman

Do we have the swing at Luton?

Gerald

Well, I've worked out the swing, but it's a secret.

Linkman

Er, well, ah, there...there

Linkman

isn't

Linkman

the swing, how about a swong?

Norman

Well, I've got the swong here in this box and it's looking fine. I can see through the breathing holes that it's eating up peanuts at the rate of knots.

Linkman

And how about the swang?

Alphonse

Well, it's 29% up over six hunded feet but it's a little bit soft around the edges about...

Linkman

What do you make of the nylon dot cardigan and plastic mule rest?

Voice

There's no such thing.

Linkman

Thank you, Spike.

Norman

Can I just come in here and say that the swong has choked itself to death.

George

Well, the election's really beginning to hot up now.

Eric

I can't add anything to that.

Colin

Can I just add at this point that this is in fact the second time I've ever been on television?

Linkman

I'm sorry, Sasha, we're just about to get another result.

Well, I've just heard from Luton that my auntie's ill, er, possibly, possibly gastro-enteritis - Gerald.

Gerald

Er, well, if this were repeated over the whole country it's probably be very messy. Colin.

Colin

Can I just butt in and say here that it's probably the last time I shall ever appear on television.

Linkman

No I'm afraid you can't, we haven't got time. Just to bring you up to date with a few results, er, that you may have missed. Engelbert Humperdinck has taken Barrow-in-Furness, that's a gain from Ann Haydon-Jones and her husband Pip. Arthur Negus has held Bristols. That's not a result, that's a bit of gossip. Er...Mary Whitehouse has just taken umbrage. Could it be a bit of trouble there. And apparently Wales is not swinging at all. No surprise there. And...Monty Python has held the credits.

Roll credits. Lots of activity behind from the experts.

At the end of these titles cut to a country road. After three seconds a motorbike appears in the distance and speeds towards the camera. We see that a wild-looking nun is riding it.

First Voice Over

Yes, it's Attila the Nun.

Attila the Nun flashes past the camera, There is a loud sound of the bike crashing off camera.

Second Voice Over

A simple country girl who took a vow of eternal brutality.

Attila the Nun on a hospital bed, struggling wildly with two doctors and a nurse who are trying to hold her down. She looks really fearsome. Another doctor enters and summons the nurse away.

Doctor

Nurse!

The camera tracks away and comes up on another bed in which is sitting a beautiful girl revealing more than a patient normally would and endowed with Carol's . . . undoubted attributes. Screens are placed around her. The doctor and nurse come in through the screens.

Doctor

Hello, Miss Norris. How are you?

Miss Norris

Not too bad, thank you, doctor.

Doctor

Yes, well I think I'd better examine you.

Cut to a line of half a dozen shabby men in filthy macs down to the floor and caps, who shuffle in through the screens and stand at the foot of the bed leering.

After about five seconds the music reaches a climax and ends. The men in macs all applaud.

Cut to reverse angle to show that we are no longer in a hospital but in a seedy strip club. The curtains have just swished shut.

Compère

Thank you, thank you. Charles Crompton, the Stripping Doctor. And next, gentlemen and ladies, here at the Peephole Club for the very first time - a very big welcome please for the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Affairs.

Curtains open. The compère leaves the stage. A man in city gent's outfit walks into the spotlight.

Minister

Good evening. Tonight I'd like to restate our position on agricultural subsidies,

Minister

soft breathy jazzy music creeps in behind his words and he starts to strip as he talks

Minister

he has now removed all his clothes apart from a tassel on each nipple and one on the front of some skin-tight briefs; he starts to revolve the tassels on his nipples

Minister

he turns revealing a tassle on each buttock which he also revolves

Minister

and for world peace. Thank you and goodnight.

He removes the last tassle from his G-string with a flourish. Blackout and curtains quickly close. Compère bounces back on stage.

Compère

Wasn't he marvellous? The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Affairs! And now gentlemen and ladies, a very big welcome please for the Minister of Pensions and Social Security!

Burst of Turkish music and curtains swish back as another bowler-hatted pinstriped minister enters doing a Turkish dance.

Mr Concrete

I dunno.

Mrs Concrete

Was it Reginald Bosanquet?

Mr Concrete

No, no, no.

Mrs Concrete

Did he have his head all bandaged?

Mr Concrete

No, it wasn't like that. They had lots of lights and cameras and tape recorders and all that sort of thing.

Mrs Concrete

Oh, that'll be Ray Baxter and the boys and girls from 'Tomorrow's World'. Oh, I prefer Reginald Bosanquet, there's not so many of them.

Mrs Concrete

Ratcatcher

Oh, I gather you've got a little rodental problem.

Baa ... baa ... baa ... baa ... baa ... baa...

Ratcatcher

No, that's sheep you've got there.

Voice Over

Baa ... baa.

Ratcatcher

No, that's definitely sheep. A bit of a puzzle, really.

Mrs Concrete

Is it?

Ratcatcher

Yeah, well, I mean it's (a) not going to respond to a nice piece of cheese and (b) it isn't going to fit into a trap.

Mrs Concrete

Oh - what are you going to do?

Ratcatcher

Well, we'll have to look for the hole.

We follow them as they look along the wainscotting.

Mrs Concrete

Oh yeah. There's one here.

She indicates a small black mousehole.

Ratcatcher

No, no, that's mice.

He reaches in and pulls out a line of mice strung out on a piece of elastic. Then he lets go so they shoot in again. The ratcatcher moves on. He moves a chair, behind which there is a three-foot-high black hole.

Ratcatcher

Ah, this is what we're after.

The baa-ings get louder. At this point six cricketers enter the room.

Cricketer

Excuse me, is the third test in here?

Mr Concrete

No - that was a joke - a joke!

Cricketer

Oh blimey,

Cricketer

Ratcatcher

Right. Well, I'm going in the wainscotting.

Cut to 'Wains Cotting' woman, who rushes out again.

Woman

They said it again.

Back to the sitting room.

Ratcatcher

I'm going to lay down some sheep poison.

He disappears into the hole. We hear:

Voice Over

Baa, baa, baa.

A gunshot. The ratcatcher reappears clutching his arm.

Ratcatcher

Aagh. Ooh! It's got a gun!

Mrs Concrete

Blimey.

Ratcatcher

Now, normally a sheep is a placid, timid creature, but you've got a killer.

Poster: 'Wanted For Armed Robbery - Basil' with a picture of a sheep. Exciting crime-type music. Mix through to newspaper headlines: 'Farmers Ambushed in Pen', 'Merino Ram in Wages Grab'. Eerie science fiction music; mix through to a laboratory. A scientist looking through microscope and his busty attractive assistant.

Professor

It's an entirely new strain of sheep, a killer sheep that can not only hold a rifle but is also a first-class shot.

Assistant

But where are they coming from, professor?

Professor

That I don't know. I just don't know. I really just don't know. I'm afraid I really just don't know. I'm afraid even I really just don't know. I have to tell you I'm afraid even I really just don't know. I'm afraid I have to tell you...

Professor

she hands him a glass of water which she had been busy getting as soon as he started into this speech

Professor

resuming normal breezy voice

Professor

... I don't know. Our only clue is this portion of wolf's clothing which the killer sheep ...

Cut to Viking.

Viking

... was wearing...

Cut back to sketch.

Professor

... in yesterday's raid on Selfridges.

Assistant

I'll carry out tests on it straight away, professor.

She opens a door to another lab; but it is full of cricketers.

Cricketer

Hello, is the third test in here, please?

She slams the door on them.

Assistant

Professor, there are some cricketers in the laboratory.

Professor

This may be even more serious than even I had at first been imagining. What a strange... strange line. There's no time to waste. Get me the Chief Commissioner of Police.

Assistant

Yes, sir!

She opens a cupboard and slides out the Chief Commissioner of Police on a sort of slab. He grins and waves cheerily. 'This is Your Life' music and applause.

Professor

No, no, on the phone.

Assistant

Oh...

Assistant

she pushes him back in

Professor

Look of fear!

Professor

he is staring transfixed at something in the doorway

Professor

Another strange line. Look out, Miss Garter Oil!

Assistant

Professor! What is it? What have you seen?

Professor

Look - there, in the doorway.

Cut to doorway: through it is animation of a huge sheep with an eye patch.

Assistant

Urghhh! Arthur X! Leader of the Pennine Gang!

ANIMATION:

perhaps even mixed with stock film - as the fevered mind of Gilliam takes it - sheep armed to the teeth, sheep executing dangerous raids, Basil Cassidy and the Sundance Sheep, sheep with machine gun coming out of its arse etc.

At the end of the animation, cut to studio. A narrator sitting in what could be a news set at a desk.

Narrator

But soon the killer sheep began to infect other animals with its startling intelligence. Pussy cats began to arrange mortgages, cocker spaniels began to design supermarkets...

Cut back to the aninmation again: a parrot.

Parrot

And parrots started to announce television programmes. It's 8 o'clock and time for the News.

Narrator

Good evening. Here is the news for Parrots. No parrots were involved in an accident on the M1 today when a lorry carrying high-octane fuel was in collison with a bollard. That's a

Music reaches a climax and we mix slowly through to an eighteenth-century living room. Lucy is nursing her father. Some low music continues over. Suddenly the door bursts open and Charles Darnay enters.

The narrator's voice fade.

Voice Over

And while that's going on, here from Westminster is a parliamentary report for Humans.

Cyril

In the debate, a spokesman accused the goverment of being silly and doing not at all good things. The member accepted this in the spirit of healthy criticism, but denied that he had ever been naughty with a choir boy. Angry shouts of 'What about the Watermelon then?' were ordered then by the speaker to be stricken from the record and put into a brown paper bag in the lavvy. Any further interruptions would be cut up and distributed amongst the poor. For the Government, a front-bench spokesman said the Agricultural Tariff

Cyril

would

Cyril

have to be raised, and he fancied a bit. Futhermore, he argued, this would give a large boost to farmers, him, his friends, and Miss Moist of Knightsbridge. From the back benches there were opposition shouts of 'Postcards for sale' and a healthy cry of 'Who likes a sailor then?' from the minister without portfolio. Replying, the Shadow Minister said he could no longer deny the rumors, but he and the Dachshund were very happy. And in any case he argued Rhubarb was cheap, and what was the harm in a sauna bath?

ANIMATION:

a vicious rampaging bun.

Voice Over

Well that's all for Attila the Bun, and now - idiots!

A village idiot in smock and straw hat, red cheeks, straw in mouth, sitting on a wall, making funny noises and rolling his eyes.

Voice Over

Arthur Figgis is an idiot. A village idiot. Tonight we look at the idiot in society.

Cut to close-up of Figgis talking to camera. Very big close-up losing the top and bottom of his head.

Figgis

educated voice

Figgis

suddenly switches to rural accent

Figgis

vicar passes and gives him sixpence

Figgis

passing lady gives him sixpence

Figgis

Thank you, Mrs Thompson... this is the role that I and members of my family have fulfilled in this village for the past four hundred years... Good morning, Mr Jenkins, ICI have increased their half-yearly dividend, I see.

We see Mr Jenkins pass, he is also an idiot, identically dressed.

Mr Jenkins

Yes, splendid.

Figgis

That's Mr Jenkins - he's another idiot. And so you see the idiot does provide a vital psycho-social service for this community. Oh, excuse me, a coach party has just arrived. I shall have to fall off the wall, I'm afraid.

He falls backwards off the wall. Cut to Figgins in idiot's costume coming out of a suburban home. He walks on to the lawn on which are several pieces of gym equipment. He runs head-on into horse (speeded up) and falls over, concussed.

Voice Over

Arthur takes idiotting seriously. He is up at six o'clock every morning working on special training equipment designed to keep him silly. And of course he takes great pride in his appearance.

Figgis, dressed in nice clean smock, jumps into a pond. He immediately scrambles up, pulls out a mirror and pats mud an his face critically, as if making-up.

Voice Over

Like the doctor, the blacksmith, the carpenter, Mr Figgis is an important figure in this village and - like them - he uses the local bank.

Village square. A bank. Figgis is walking towards it. People giggling and pointing. He goes into a silly routine. Figgis enters the bank. Cut to bank manager standing outside bank.

CAPTION: 'M. BRANDO - BANK MANAGER'

Bank Manager

Yes, we have quite a number of idiots banking here.

Voice Over

What kind of money is there in idioting?

Manager

Well nowadays a really blithering idiot can make anything up to ten thousand pounds a year - if he's the head of some big industrial combine. But of course, the more old-fashioned idiot still refuses to take money.

We see Figgis handing over a cheque to cashier; cashier pushes across a pile of moss, pebbles, bits of wood and acorns.

Manager

voice over

Manager

He takes bits of string, wood, dead budgerigars, sparrows, anything, but it does make the cashier's job very difficult; but of course they're fools to themselves because the rate of interest over ten years on a piece of moss or a dead vole is almost negligible.

A clerk appears at door of bank.

Clerk

Mr Brando.

Manager

Yes?

Clerk

Hollywood on the phone.

Manager

I'll take it in the office.

Cut to a woodland glade.

Voice Over

But Mr Figgis is no ordinary idiot. He is a lecturer in idiocy at the University of East Anglia. Here he is taking a class of third-year students.

Half a dozen loonies led by Figgis come dancing through the glade singing tunelessly. They are wearing long University scarves.

Voice Over

After three years of study these apprentice idiots receive a diploma of idiocy, a handful of mud and a kick on the head.

A vice-chancellor stands in a University setting with some young idiots in front of him. They wear idiot gear with BA hoods. One walks forward to him, he gets a diploma, a faceful of mud and stoops to receive his kick on the head. Cut to happy parents smiling proudly.

Voice Over

But some of the older idiots resent the graduate idiot.

Old Idiot

I'm a completely self-taught idiot. I mean, ooh arh, nob arhh, nob arhh .... nobody does that anymore. Anybody who did that round here would be laughed off the street. No, nowadays people want something wittier.

Wife empties breakfast over him. Cut to idiot falling repeatedly off a wall.

Voice Over

But what of the idiot's private life? How about his relationship with women?

Idiot in bed. Pull back to reveal he shares it with two very young, thin, nude girls.

Idiot

Well I may be an idiot but I'm no fool.

Voice Over

But the village idiot's dirty smock and wall-falling are a far cry from the modern world of the urban idiot.

Interviewer

The headquarters of these urban idiots is here in St John's Wood. Inside they can enjoy the company of other idiots and watch special performances of ritual idioting.

Fifth Idiot

Ah!

Another very quick wide-shot of Lords. There is nothing at all happening and we can't distinguish anyone. Cut to three TV commentators in modern box, with sliding window open. They are surrounded by bottles.

Jim

Good afternoon and welcome to Lords on the second day of the first test. So far today we've had five hours batting from England and already they're nought for nought. Cowdrey is not out nought. Naughton is not in. Knott is in and is nought for not out. Naughton of Northants got a nasty knock on the nut in the nets last night but it's nothing of note. Next in is Nat Newton of Notts. Not Nutring - Nutting's at nine, er, Nutring knocked neatie nighty knock knock...

Jim

another commentator nudges him

Jim

... anyway England have played extremely well for nothing, not a sausage, in reply to Iceland's first innings total of 722 for 2 declared, scored yesterday disappointingly fast in only twenty-one overs with lots of wild slogging and boundaries and all sorts of rubbishy things. But the main thing is that England have made an absolutely outstanding start so far, Peter?

Peter

Splendid. Just listen to those thighs. And now it's the North East's turn with the Samba. Brian.

Brian

he has an enormous nose

Brian

opens book

Brian

I'm reminded of the story of Gubby Allen in '32. ..

Jim

Oh, shut up or we'll close the bar. And now Bo Wildeburg is running up to bowl to Cowdrey, he runs up, he bowls to Cowdrey...

Cut to fast bowler. He bowls the ball but the batsman makes no move whatsoever. The ball passes the off stump.

Jim

... and no shot at all. Extremely well not played there.

Peter

Yes, beautifully not done anything about.

Brian

A superb shot of no kind whatsoever. I well remember Plum Warner leaving a very similar ball alone in 1732.

Jim

Oh shut up, long nose.

Jim

Peter falls off his chair.

Jim

And now it's Bo Wildeburg running in again to bowl to Cowdrey, he runs in.

Jim

bowler bowls us before; ball goes by as before

Jim

He bowls to Cowdrey - and no shot at all, a superb display of inertia there... And that's the end of the over, and drinks.

Peter

Gin and tonic please.

Jim

No, no the players are having drinks. And now, what's happening? I think Cowdrey's being taken off.

Jim

Two men in white coats, a la furniture removers, so maybe they're brown coats, are carrying the batsman off. Two men pass them with a green Chesterfield sofa making for the wicket.

Jim

Yes, Cowdrey is being carried off. Well I never. Now who's in next, it should be number three, Natt Newton of Notts... get your hand off my thigh, West... no I don't think it is... I think it's er, it's the sofa ... no it's the Chesterfield! The green Chesterfield is coming in at number three to take guard now.

Brian

I well remember a similar divan being brought on at Headingley in 9 BC against the darkies.

Jim

Oh, shut up, elephant snout. And now the green Chesterfield has taken guard and Iceland are putting on their spin dryer to bowl.

Furniture fielding. The whole pitch is laid out with bits of furniture in correct positions. Three chairs in the slips; easy chair keeping wicket; bidet at mid on; TV set at cover; bookcase at mid off; roll-top writing desk at square leg; radiator at mid wicket etc. The spin dryer moves forward and bowls a real ball with its snozzle to a table, which is at the batting end with cricket pads on. It hits the table on the pad. Appeal.

Jim

The spin dryer moves back to his mark, it runs out to the wicket, bowls to the table... a little bit short but it's coming in a bit there and it's hit him on the pad... and the table is out, leg before wicket. That is England nought for one.

Different Voice Over

And now we leave Lords and go over to Epsom for the three o'clock.

Cut to a race course. Furniture comes into shot racing the last fifty yards to the finishing post.

Commentator

Well here at Epsom we take up the running with fifty yards of this mile and a half race to go and it's the wash basin in the lead from WC Pedestal. Tucked in nicely there is the sofa going very well with Joanna Southcott's box making a good run from hat stand on the rails, and the standard lamp is failing fast but it's wash basin definitely taking up the running now being strongly pressed by ... At the post it's the wash basin from WC then sofa, hat stand, standard lamp and lastly Joanna Southcott's box.

Cut to three bishops shouting from actual studio audience.

Bishops

Open the box! Open the box! Open the box! Open the box! Open the box!

Woman

Ooh, that was lucky. I never even heard of him.

Michael Miles

Woman

Goats. Underwater goats with snorkels and flippers.

Michael Miles

No, no.

Woman

A buffalo with an aqualung.

Woman

Reginald Maudling.

Michael Miles

Yes, that's near enough. I'll give you that. Right, now, Mrs Scum, you have won your prize, do you still want the blow on the head?

Woman

Yes, yes.

Michael Miles

I'll offer you a poke in the eye.

Woman

No! I want a blow on the head.

Michael Miles

A punch in the throat?

Woman

No.

Michael Miles

All right then, a kick in the kneecap?

Michael Miles

Mrs Scum, I'm offering you a boot in the teeth and a dagger up the strap?

Woman

Er...

Interviewer

Hello. On 'Archaeology Today' tonight I have with me Professor Lucien Kastner of Oslo University.

Kastner

Good evening.

Interviewer

How tall are you, professor?

Kastner

Interviewer

How tall are you?

Kastner

I'm about five foot ten.

Interviewer

... and an expert in Egyptian tomb paintings. Sir Robert...

Interviewer

turning to Kastner

Interviewer

are you really five foot ten?

Kastner

Yes.

Interviewer

Funny, you look much shorter than that to me. Are you slumped forward in your chair at all?

Kastner

No, er I...

Interviewer

Extraordinary. Sir Robert Eversley, who's just returned from the excavations in El Ara, and you must be well over six foot. Isn't that right, Sir Robert?

Sir Robert

puzzled

Sir Robert

Yes.

Interviewer

In fact, I think you're six foot five aren't you?

Applause from off. Sir Robert looks up in amazement.

Interviewer

Oh, that's marvelous. I mean you're a totally different kind of specimen to Professor Kastner. Straight in your seat, erect, firm.

Sir Robert

Yes. I thought we were here to discuss archaeology.

Interviewer

Yes, yes, of course we are, yes, absolutely, you're absolutely right! That's positive thinking for you.

Interviewer

Interviewer

he turns his back very ostentatiously on Kastner

Interviewer

Sir Robert Eversley, who's very interesting, what have you discovered in the excavations at El Ara?

Sir Robert

picking up a beautiful ancient vase

Sir Robert

Well basically we have found a complex of tombs...

Interviewer

Very good speaking voice.

Sir Robert

... which present dramatic evidence of Polynesian influence in Egypt in the third dynasty which is quite remarkable.

Interviewer

How tall were the Polynesians?

Kastner

They were...

Interviewer

Sh!

Sir Robert

Well, they were rather small, seafaring...

Interviewer

Short men, were they... eh? All squat and bent up?

Sir Robert

Well, I really don't know about that...

Interviewer

Who were the tall people?

Sir Robert

I'm afraid I don't know.

Interviewer

Who's that very tall tribe in Africa?

Sir Robert

Well, this is hardly archaeology.

Interviewer

The Watutsi! That's it - the Watutsi! Oh, that's the tribe, some of them were eight foot tall. Can you imagine that. Eight foot of Watutsi. Not one on another's shoulders, oh no - eight foot of solid Watutsi. That's what I call tall.

Sir Robert

Yes, but it's nothing to do with archaeology.

Interviewer

knocking Sir Robert's vase to the floor

Interviewer

Oh to hell with archaeology!

Kastner

Can I please speak! I came all the way from Oslo to do this program! I'm a professor of archaeology. I'm an expert in ancient civilizations. All right, I'm only five foot ten. All right my posture is bad, all right I slump in my chair. But I've had more women than either of you two! I've had half bloody Norway, that's what I've had! So you can keep your Robert Eversley! And you can keep your bloody Watutsi! I'd rather have my little body... my little five-foot-ten-inch body...

Kastner

he breaks down sobbing

Sir Robert

Bloody fool. Look what you've done to him.

Interviewer

Don't bloody fool me.

Sir Robert

I'll do what I like, because I'm six foot five and I eat punks like you for breakfast.

Sir Robert floors the interviewer with a mighty punch. Interviewer looks up rubbing his jaw.

Interviewer

I'll get you for that, Eversley! I'll get you if I have to travel to the four corners of the earth!

Interviewer

All right Eversley, get up out of that trench.

Sir Robert

Don't forget... I'm six foot five.

The six of them charge each other. They fight in amongst the trestle tables with rare pots on them breaking and smashing them. When the fight ends everyone lies dead in a pile of broken pottery. The interviewer crawls up to camera and produces a microphone from his pocket. He is covered in blood and in his final death throes.

Cut to studio. A vicar sitting facing camera. He has an axe in his head.

Reverend Belling

You know, there are many people in the country today who, through no fault of their own, are sane. Some of them were born sane. Some of them became sane later in their lives. It is up to people like you and me who are out of our tiny little minds to try and help these people overcome their sanity. You can start in small ways with ping-pong ball eyes and a funny voice and then you can paint half of your body red and the other half green and then you can jump up and down in a bowl of treacle going 'squawk, squawk, squawk...' And then you can go 'Neurhhh! Neurhh!' and then you can roll around on the floor going 'pting pting pting' ...

A boxer (Terry G) rushes in and fells her with one blow. After Women's Institute applauding cut to: a man coming through a door with a neat little bride in a bridal dress. The man walks up to the registrar who is sitting at his desk with a sign saying 'Registrar of Marriages '.

Man

Good morning.

Registrar

Good morning.

Man

Are you the registrar?

Registrar

I have that function.

Man

I was here on Saturday, getting married to a blond girl, and I'd like to change please. I'd like to have this one instead please.

Registrar

What do you mean?

Man

Er, well, the other one wasn't any good, so I'd like to swap it for this one, please. Er, I have paid. I paid on Saturday. Here's the ticket.

Man

gives him the marriage licence.

Registrar

Ah, oh, no. That was when you were married.

Man

Er, yes. That was when I was married to the wrong one. I didn't like the colour. This is the one I want to have, so if you could just change the forms round I can take this one back with me now.

Registrar

I can't do that.

Man

Look, make it simpler, I'll pay again.

Registrar

No, you can't

Registrar

do

Registrar

that.

Man

Look, all I want you to do is change the wife, say the words, blah, blab, blah, back to my place, no questions asked.

Registrar

I'm sorry sir, but we're not allowed to change.

Man

You can at Harrods.

Registrar

You can't.

Man

You can. I changed my record player and there wasn't a grumble.

Registrar

It's different.

Man

And I changed my pet snake, and I changed my Robin Day tie.

Registrar

Well, you can't change a bloody wife!

Man

Oh, all right! Well, can I borrow one for the weekend.

Registrar

No!

Man

Oh, blimey, I only wanted a jolly good...

A whistle blows. A referee runs on, takes his book out and proceeds to take the name of the man in the registry office, amidst protests.

Referee

All right, break it up. What's your number, then? All right. Name?

Man

Cook.

Cut to the two in the next sketch waiting. Cut back to referee, who finishes booking the man and blows his whistle. The show continues. Cut to the two waiting. On the sound of the whistle they start acting.

CAPTION: 'THAT SKETCH HAS BEEN ABANDONED'

Animation sketch leads us into a cocktail party in Dulwich. Quiet party-type music. Constant chatter.

Host

Ah, John. Allow me to introduce my next-door neighbour. John Stokes, this is A Snivelling Little Rat-Faced Git. Ah!

Mr Git

Hello, I noticed a slight look of anxiety cross your face for a moment just then, but you needn't worry - I'm used to it. That's the trouble of having a surname like Git.

John

Oh ... yes, yes.

Mr Git

We did think once of having it changed by deed-poll, you know - to Watson or something like that. But A Snivelling Little Rat-Faced Watson's just as bad eh?

John

Yes, yes, I suppose so.

Mrs Git approaches.

Mr Git

Oh, that's my wife. Darling! Come and meet Mr... what was it?

John

Stokes - John Stokes.

Mr Git

Oh yes. John Stokes, this is my wife, Dreary Fat Boring Old.

John

Oh, er, how do you do.

Mrs Git

How do

Mrs Git

you

Mrs Git

do.

Mrs Stokes appears.

Mrs Stokes

Darling, there you are!

John

Yes, yes, here I am, yes.

Mr Git

Oh, is this your wife?

John

Yes, yes, yes, this is the wife. Yes. Um darling, these, these are the Gits.

Mrs Stokes

slightly shocked

Mrs Stokes

What?

John

The Gits.

Mr Git

Oh, heaven's sakes we are being formal. Does it have to be surnames?

John

Oh, no, no. Not at all. No. Um, no, this... this... this is my wife Norah, er, Norah Jane, Norah Jane Stokes. This is Snivelling Little Rat-Faced Git. And this is his wife Dreary Fat Boring Old Git.

Mr Git

I was just telling your husband what an awful bore it is having a surname like Git.

Mrs Stokes

understanding at last

Mrs Stokes

OH Oh well, it's not that bad.

Mr Git

Oh, you've no idea how the kids get taunted. Why, only last week Dirty Lying Little Two-Faced came running home from school, sobbing his eyes out, and our youngest, Ghastly Spotty Horrible Vicious Little is just at the age when taunts like 'she's a git' really hurt. Yes.

Mrs Git gobs colourfully into her handbag.

John

Do ... do you live round here?

Mr Git

Yes, we live up the road, number 49 - you can't miss it. We've just had the outside painted with warm pus.

John

with increasing embarrassment

John

Oh.

Mr Git

Yes. It's very nice actually. It goes nicely with the vomit and catarrh we've got smeared all over the front door.

Mrs Stokes

I think we ought to be going. We have two children to collect.

Mr Git

Oh, well, bring them round for tea tomorrow.

Mrs Stokes

Well...

Mr Git

It's Ghastly Spotty Cross-Eyed's birthday and she's having a disembowelling party for a few friends. The Nauseas will be there, and Doug and Janice Mucus, and the Rectums from Swanage.

Voice Over

Cut to exactly the same set-up as before.

Host

John! Allow me to introduce our next-door neighhour. John, this is Mr Watson.

Watson

Hello. I noticed a slight look of anxiety cross your face just then but you needn't worry.

Cut to nun.

Nun

I preferred the dirty version.

She is knocked out by the boxer.

Cut to Women's Institute applause film.

Big close-up Hank Spim (face only). He is obviously walking along, the camera is following him hand held.

Hank

Well, I've been a hunter all my life. I love animals. That's why I like to kill 'em. I wouldn't kill an animal I didn't like. Goodday Roy.

Pull back to reveal he is walking with his brother in fairly rough country location. They pull a small trailer with 'high explosives' written in large letters on the side. The trailer has bombs in it. Hank takes a bazooka from the trailer.

Voice Over

Hank and Roy Spim are tough, fearless backwoodsmen who have chosen to live in a violent, unrelenting world of nature's creatures, where only the fittest survive. Today they are off to hunt mosquitoes.

Big close-up Roy Spim. He is obviously searching for something.

Roy

voice over

Roy

The mosquito's a clever little bastard. You can track him for days and days until you really get to know him like a friend. He knows you're there, and you know he's there. It's a game of wits. You hate him, then you respect him, then you kill him.

Cut to Hank Spim who stands peering toward the horizon. Suddenly he points.

Voice Over

Suddenly Hank spots the mosquito they're after.

Dramatic music. Crash zoom along Hank's eyeline to as big a close-up as we can get of a patch in a perfectly ordinary field. Cut back to Hank and Roy starting to crawl towards some bushes.

Voice Over

Now more than ever, they must rely on the skills they have learnt from a lifetime's hunting.

Roy points machine gun at head of mosquito and fires off another few rounds

Roy

There's nothing more dangerous than a wounded mosquito.

Here, surrounded by their trophies Roy and Hank prepare for a much tougher ordeal - a moth hunt.

Hank

Well, I follow the moth in the helicopter to lure it away from the flowers, and then Roy comes along in the Lockheed Starfighter and attacks it with air-to-air missiles.

Roy

A lot of people have asked us why we don't use fly spray. Well, where's the sport in that?

Shot of them driving in Land Rover heavily loaded with weapons.

Voice Over

For Roy, sport is everything. Ever since he lost his left arm battling with an ant, Roy has risked his life in the pursuit of tiny creatures.

Voice Over

a peaceful river bank; Roy and Hank are fishing

Voice Over

Hank presses a button and there is a tremendous explosion in the water

Voice Over

Wherever there is a challenge, Hank and Roy Spim will be there ready to carry on this primordial struggle between man and inoffensive, tiny insects.

Pull out to reveal the brothers standing on a tank. Heroic music reaches a climax.

Apropos of nothing cut to oak-panelled robing chamber in the Old Bailey. Two Judges in full wigs and red robes enter.

First Judge

very camp

First Judge

Oh, I've had such a morning in the High Court. I could stamp my little feet the way those QC's carry on.

Second Judge

just as camp

Second Judge

Don't I know it, love.

First Judge

Objection here, objection there! And that nice policeman giving his evidence so well - beautiful speaking voice ... well after a bit all I could do was bang my little gavel.

Second Judge

You what, love?

First Judge

I banged me gavel. I did me 'silence in court' bit. Ooh! If looks could kill that prosecuting counsel would be in for thirty years. How did your summing up go?

Second Judge

Well, I was quite pleased actually. I was trying to do my butch voice, you know, 'what the jury must understand', and they loved it, you know. I could see that foreman eyeing me.

First Judge

Really?

Second Judge

Yes, cheeky devil.

First Judge

Was he that tall man with that very big... ?

Second Judge

No, just a minute - I must finish you know. Anyway, I finished up with 'the actions of these vicious men is a violent stain on the community and the full penalty of the law is scarcely sufficient to deal with their ghastly crimes', and I waggled my wig! Just ever so slightly, but it was a stunning effect.

First Judge

Oh, I bet it was... like that super time I wore that striped robe in the Magistrates Court.

Second Judge

Oh, aye.

Fade out. Fade into a bench in a public park, garden or square. A pepperpot is sitting on the bench. Another pepperpot comes by pushing a shopping trolley.

First Pepperpot

Hello, Mrs Thing.

Second Pepperpot

Hello, Mrs Entity.

First Pepperpot

How are you then?

Second Pepperpot

Oh, I have had a morning.

First Pepperpot

Busy?

Second Pepperpot

Busy - huh! I got up at five o'dock, I made myself a cup of tea, I looked out of the window. Well, by then I was so worn out I had to come and have a sit-down. I've been here for seven hours.

First Pepperpot

You must be exhausted.

Second Pepperpot

Mm. Oh, have you been shopping?

First Pepperpot

No, I've been shopping.

Second Pepperpot

Funny.

First Pepperpot

I'm worn out. I've been shopping for six hours.

Second Pepperpot

What have you bought, then?

First Pepperpot

Nothing. Nothing at all. A complete waste of time.

Second Pepperpot

Wicked, isn't it?

First Pepperpot

Wicked. It'll be worse when we join the Common Market.

Second Pepperpot

That nice Mr Heath would never allow that.

First Pepperpot

It's funny he never married.

Second Pepperpot

He's a bachelor.

First Pepperpot

Oooh! That would explain it, Oh dear me, this chatting away wears me out.

Second Pepperpot

Yes. I bet Mrs Reginald Maudling doesn't have to put up with all this drudgery, getting up at five in the morning, making a cup of tea, looking out of the window, chatting away.

First Pepperpot

No! It'd all be done for her.

Second Pepperpot

Yes, she'd have the whole day free for playing snooker.

First Pepperpot

She probably wouldn't go through all the drudgery of playing snooker, day in, day out.

Second Pepperpot

No, it would all be done for her. She wouldn't even have to lift the cue.

First Pepperpot

She probably doesn't even know where the billlard room is.

Second Pepperpot

No, still, it's not as bad as the old days. Mrs Stanley Baldwin used to have to get up at five o'clock in the morning and go out and catch partridges with her bare hands.

First Pepperpot

Yes... and Mrs William Pitt the Elder used to have to get up at three o'clock and go burrowing for truffles with the bridge of her nose.

Second Pepperpot

Mrs Beethoven used to have to get up at midnight to spur on the mynah bird.

First Pepperpot

Lazy creatures, mynah birds,..

Second Pepperpot

Yes. When Beethoven went deaf the mynah bird just used to mime.

The picture begins to wobble as in flashback; appropriate dreamy music effect.

First Pepperpot

looking at camera

First Pepperpot

Ooh! What's happening?

Second Pepperpot

It's all right. It's only a flashback.

Cut to Beethoven's living room. A model mynah bird is opening and shutting its beak. Beethoven is sitting at the piano.

Beethoven

You don't fool me, you stupid mynah bird. I'm not deaf yet.

Mynah

Just you wait... ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

Mynah

Beethoven pulls a revolver and shoots the bird which falls to the ground

Mynah

Oh! Bugger...

Beethoven

Shut up!

Mynah

Right in the wing.

Beethoven

Shut your beak. Gott in Himmel... I never get any peace here.

He plays the first few notes of the fifth symphony, trying vainly to get the last note. Mrs Beethoven enters.

Mrs Beethoven

Ludwig!

Beethoven

What?

Mrs Beethoven

Have you seen the sugar bowl?

Beethoven

No, I haven't seen the bloody sugar bowl.

Mrs Beethoven

You know ... the

Mrs Beethoven

sugar

Mrs Beethoven

Beethoven

Sod the sugar bowl... I'm trying to finish this stinking tune! It's driving me spare ... so shut up!

Beethoven

she leaves; he goes into opening bars of 'Washington Post March

Beethoven

No, no, no, no, no.

Mrs Beethoven comes back in.

Mrs Beethoven

Ludwig, have you seen the jam spoon?

Beethoven

Stuff the jam spoon!

Mrs Beethoven

It was in the sugar bowl.

Beethoven

Look, get out you old rat-bag. Buzz off and shut up.

Mrs Beethoven

I don't know what you see in that piano.

Mrs Beethoven

Mrs Beethoven comes in again.

Mrs Beethoven

Do you want peanut butter or sandwich spread for your tea?

Beethoven

What!!!!

Mrs Beethoven

PEANUT BUTTER...

Beethoven

I've forgotten it.

Beethoven

plays a few wrong notes

Beethoven

I had it! I had it!

Mrs Beethoven

Do you want peanut butter or sandwich spread?

Beethoven

I don't care!!

Mrs Beethoven

Ooooh! I don't know.

Mrs Beethoven

at the same moment as he gets it right again, the door flies open and Mrs Beethoven charges in with a very load vacuum

Beethoven

a terrible clanking and banging comes from the wall

Beethoven

What's that! What's that!

Mrs Beethoven

still vacuuming loudly

Mrs Beethoven

It's the plumber!

A jarring ring of the doorbell adds to the din.

Beethoven

Gott in Himmel, I'm going out.

Mrs Beethoven

Well, if you're going out don't forget we've got the Mendelssohns coming for tea so don't forget to order some pikelets.

Beethoven

Pikelets, pikelets. Shakespeare never had this trouble.

Shakespeare washing up at a sink present day.

Shakespeare

You wanna bet? Incidentally, its da-da-da-dum, da-da-da-dum.

Cut back to Beethoven.

Beethoven

You're right. Oh, incidentally, why not call him Hamlet?

Cut back to Shakespeare

Shakespeare

Hamlet I like much better than David.

Shakespeare

use David. I won't sue

Cut to Michelangelo's studio. Michelangelo is in middle of feeding and looking after at least six screaming little babies. His statue of David is in the foreground.

Michelangelo

Thanks, but I've had a better idea.

Camera pans down to show engraved on plinth beneath statue the words 'Michelangelo's Fifth Symphony'.

Camera tracks in to a shopfront with a large sign outside: 'Rodent Exterminating Boutique - Colin "Chopper" Mozart (Son Of Composer) Ratcatcher To The Nobility And Ordinary People, Too - Ici On Parle Portugaise'. At the door of shop stands Colin Mozart. A kid runs up to him bearing a long cleft stick, Mozart takes the note from the cleavage and reads it.

Colin Mozart

Aha! Rats at 42a Kartoffelnstrasse. Hey Mitzi! I gotta go to Potato Street.

Beethoven's front door is opened by Mrs Beethoven.

Mrs Beethoven

Yes?

Colin Mozart

Colin Mozart.

Mrs Beethoven

Oh, thank goodness you've come. We're having a terrible time with them bleeding rats. I think they live in his stupid piano already.

They go into the house. We hear the first two bars of Beethoven's Fifth counterpointed by loud squeaking.

Beethoven's Voice

Get out the bloody piano you stupid furry bucktoothed gits! Get out! Gott in Himmel. Get your stinking tail out of my face.

Mrs Beethoven opens the door and we see for the first time a strange sight. Rats are flying across the room (thrown from out of vision) others scuttle across floor (pulled by strings) others up wall. One sits on Beethoven's head. The squealing is deafening. Beethoven plays on relentlessly. Mozart and Mrs Beethoven run into room and start trying to catch the rats with the shrimp-nets.

CAPTION: '13.4 MINUTES LATER'

Colin Mozart is sitting on the piano. He rakes the rat-infested room with machine-gunfire.

Beethoven

Shut up!

The picture starts to wobble and mixes back to the two pepperpots.

Second Pepperpot

So anyway, Beethoven was rather glad when he went deaf.

Mix to Beethoven pushing the keys of the keyboard which is all that remains of his piano. He listens vainly. The mynah bird opens and shuts its beak. In the corner an old horn gramophone plays. We hear Jimmy Durante singing the end of 'I'm the guy that found the lost chord'. Cut back to judges' robing room.

First Judge

Well, I was ever so glad they abolished hanging, you know, because that black cap just didn't suit me.

Second Judge

Yes. Do you remember the Glasgow treason trial?

First Judge

Oh yes, I wore a body stocking all through it.

Second Judge

No, hen, with the party afterwards.

First Judge

Oh, that's right. You were walking out with that very butch Clerk of the Court.

Second Judge

That's right. Ooh, he made me want to turn Queen's evidence.

Superimposed credits. Theme tune heard quietly as judges continue.

First Judge

Oh, me too. One summing up and I'm anybody's.

Second Judge

Anyway, Bailie Anderson.

First Judge

Ooh, her?

Second Judge

Yes. She's so strict. She was on at me for giving dolly sentences, you know, specially in that arson case.

First Judge

What was the verdict?

Second Judge

They preferred the brown wig.

First Judge

Mm. I love the Scottish Assizes. I know what they mean by a really well-hung jury.

Second Judge

Ooh! Get back in the witness box, you're too sharp to live!

First Judge

I'll smack your little botty!

Second Judge

Ooh! and again.

Second Judge

I had a magistrate in Bradford yesterday.

Funnily enough I felt like one in a lunchtime recess today.

First Judge

But the ones I really like are those voice over announcers on the BBC after the programs are over.

Second Judge

Oh, aye, of course, they're as bent as safety pins.

First Judge

I know, but they've got beautiful speaking voices, haven't they? 'And now a choice of viewing on BBC Television.'

Second Judge

'Here are tonight's football results.'

First and Second Judges

Mmm.

Second Bruce

That's a strange expression, Bruce.

First Bruce

Well Bruce, I heard the Prime Minister use it. S'hot enough to boil a monkey's bum in 'ere, your Majesty,' he said and she smiled quietly to herself.

Third Bruce

She's a good Sheila, Bruce and not at all stuck up.

Second Bruce

Ah, here comes the Bossfella now! - how are you, Bruce?

Enter fourth Bruce with English person, Michael

Fourth Bruce

Goodday, Bruce, Hello Bruce, how are you, Bruce? Gentlemen, I'd like to introduce a chap from pommie land... who'll be joining us this year here in the Philosophy Department of the University of Woolamaloo.

All

Goodday.

Fourth Bruce

Michael

No, it's Michael.

Second Bruce

That's going to cause a little confusion.

Third Bruce

Mind if we call you 'Bruce' to keep it clear?

Fourth Bruce

Well, Gentlemen, I think we'd better start the meeting. Before we start, though, I'll ask the padre for a prayer.

First Bruce snaps a plastic dog-collar round his neck. They all lower their heads.

First Bruce

Oh Lord, we beseech thee, have mercy on our faculty, Amen!!

All

Amen!

Fourth Bruce

Crack the tubes, right!

Fourth Bruce

Third Bruce starts opening beer cans

Fourth Bruce

Er, Bruce, I now call upon you to welcome Mr. Baldwin to the Philosophy Department.

Second Bruce

I'd like to welcome the pommy bastard to God's own earth, and I'd like to remind him that we don't like stuck-up sticky-beaks here.

All

Hear, hear! Well spoken, Bruce!

Fourth Bruce

Now, Bruce teaches classical philosophy, Bruce teaches Haegelian philosophy, and Bruce here teaches logical positivism, and is also in charge of the sheepdip.

Third Bruce

What's does new Bruce teach?

Fourth Bruce

New Bruce will be teaching political science - Machiavelli, Bentham, Locke, Hobbes, Sutcliffe, Bradman, Lindwall, Miller, Hassett, and Benet.

Second Bruce

Those are cricketers, Bruce!

Fourth Bruce

Oh, spit!

Third Bruce

Howls of derisive laughter, Bruce!

Fourth Bruce

In addition, as he's going to be teaching politics, I've told him he's welcome to teach any of the great socialist thinkers, provided he makes it clear that they were

Fourth Bruce

wrong

Fourth Bruce

They all stand up.

All

Australia, Australia, Australia, Australia, we love you. Amen!

They sit down.

Fourth Bruce

Any questions?

Second Bruce

New Bruce - are you a pooftah?

Fourth Bruce

Are you a pooftah?

Michael

No!

Fourth Bruce

No right, well gentlemen, I'll just remind you of the faculty rules: Rule one - no pooftahs. Rule two, no member of the faculty is to maltreat the Abbos in any way whatsoever - if there's anybody watching. Rule three - no pooftahs. Rule four - I don't want to catch anyone not drinking in their room after lights out. Rule five - no pooftahs. Rule six - there is

Fourth Bruce

no

Fourth Bruce

rule six! Rule seven - no pooftahs. That concludes the reading of the rules, Bruce.

First Bruce

This here's the wattle - the emblem of our land. You can stick it in a bottle or you can hold it in your hand.

Fourth Bruce

Gentlemen, at six o'clock I want every man-Bruce of you in the Sydney Harbour Bridge room to take a glass of sherry with the flying philosopher, Bruce, and I call upon you, padre, to close the meeting with a prayer.

First Bruce

Oh Lord, we beseech thee etc. etc. etc., Amen.

First Bruce

Right, let's get some Sheilas.

An Aborigine servant bursts in with an enormous tray full of enormous steaks.

Interviewer

Good evening. I have with me in the studio tonight Mr Norman St. John Polevaulter, who for the last few years has been contradicting people...Mr Polevaulter, why do you contradict people?

Polevaulter

I don't!

Interviewer

You told me that you did.

Polevaulter

I most certainly did not!

Interviewer

Oh. I see. I'll start again.

Polevaulter

No you won't!

A man sitting behind a desk in a Harley Street consulting room. Close-up of the name plate on desk in front of him. Although the camera does not reveal this for a moment, this name plate, about two inches high, continues all along the desk, off the side of it at the same height and halfway round the room. We start to track along this name plate on which is written: 'Professor Sir Adrian Furrows F.R.S. F.R.C.S. F.R.C.P. M.D.M.S. (Oxon), Mall Ph.D., M. Se. (Cantab), Ph.D. (Syd), ER.G.S., F.R.C.O.G., F.

Litt (All other places in Canada except Medicine Hat, B. Sc. 9 Brussels, Liege, Antwerp, Asse, (and Grower) '. There is a knock on the door.)

Specialist

Come in.

The door opens and Raymond Luxury Yacht enters. He cannot walk straight to the desk as his passage is barred by the strip of wood carrying the degrees, but he discovers the special hinged part of it that opens like a door. Mr Luxury Yacht has his enormous polystyrene nose. It is a foot long.

Specialist

Ah! Mr Luxury Yacht. Do sit down, please.

Mr Luxury Yacht

Ah, no, no. My name is

Mr Luxury Yacht

spelt

Mr Luxury Yacht

'Luxury Yacht' but it's pronounced 'Throatwobbler Mangrove'.

Specialist

Well, do sit down then Mr Throatwobbler Mangrove.

Mr Luxury Yacht

Thank you.

Specialist

Now, what seems to be the trouble?

Mr Luxury Yacht

Um, I'd like you to perform some plastic surgery on me.

Specialist

I see. And which particular feature of your anatomy is causing you distress?

Mr Luxury Yacht

Well, well for a long time now, in fact, even when I was a child ... I ... you know, whenever I left home to ... catch a bus, or... to catch a train... and even my tennis has suffered actually...

Specialist

Yes. To be absolutely blunt you're worried about your enormous hooter.

Mr Luxury Yacht

No!

Specialist

No?

Mr Luxury Yacht

Yes.

Specialist

Yes, and you want me to hack a bit off.

Mr Luxury Yacht

Please.

Specialist

Fine. It is a startler, isn't it? Er, do you mind if I... er.

Mr Luxury Yacht

What?

Specialist

Oh, no nothing, then, well, I'll just examine your nose.

Specialist

he does so; as he examines it the nose comes off in his hand

Specialist

Mr Luxury Yacht, this nose of yours is false. It's made of polystyrene and your own hooter's a beaut. No pruning necessary.

Mr Luxury Yacht

I'd still like the operation.

Specialist

Well, you've had the operation, you strange person.

Mr Luxury Yacht

Please do an operation.

Specialist

Well, all right, all right, but only ... if you come on a camping holiday with me.

Mr Luxury Yacht

He asked me! He asked me!

ANIMATION:

dancing generals, then the story of the killer cars.

Cut to air terminal. Pan along official air-terminal-type signs saying BEA, TWA, Air India, BOAC, the Verrifast Plaine Company Ltd. Pan down to reveal a checking-in desk. A man with porter's cap comes in, carrying two bags. He is followed by Mr and Mrs Irrelevant. He puts their cases down, hangs around and gets a tip. He goes behind the counter, takes off his porter's hat, puts on an airline-pilot-type cap, and puts on a moustache. There is a vicar standing next to him with an eye patch.

Man

Morning sir, can I help you?

Mr Irrelevant

Er, yes, we've booked on your flight for America.

Man

Oh, we don't fly to America ...

Man

vicar nudges him

Man

Oh, the American flight... Er, on the plane ... oh yes, oh we do that, all right. Safe as houses, no need for panic.

Mrs Irrelevant

Man

Thirty bob. I'm robbing myself.

Mr Irrelevant

Thirty bob!

Man

Twenty-five. Two quid the pair of yer. Er, that's without insurance.

Mr Irrelevant

Well, how much is it with insurance?

Man

Hundred and two quid. That's including the flight.

Mr Irrelevant

Do we really need insurance?

Man

No.

Man

Yes, essential.

Mr Irrelevant

Well, we'll have it with insurance please.

Man

Right - do you want it with the body and one relative flown back, or you can have both bodies flown back and no relatives, or four relatives, no bodies, and the ashes sent by parcel post.

Mr Irrelevant

How long will it take?

Man

Er, let me put it this way - no idea.

Vicar

Six hours.

Mr Irrelevant

Six?

Man

Five, ten for the pair of you.

Mrs Irrelevant

Oh, is it a jet?

Man

Well, no ... It's not so much of a jet, it's more your, er, Triumph Herald engine with wings.

Mr Irrelevant

When are you taking off?.

Man

3300 hours.

Mr Irrelevant

What?

Man

2600 hours for the pair of you.

Mrs Irrelevant

Man

Mr Irrelevant

What injections?

Man

Barley sugar injections. Calm you down. They're compulsory - Board of Trade. Promise.

Man

Mrs Irrelevant

Oh, I don't like the sound of injections.

Man

Man

Man

Man

You've got to make your mind up straight away if you're coming or not.

Mr and Mrs Irrelevant

Yes.

Man

Right, you can't change your mind. I'll ring the departure lounge.

Man

Hello? Two more on their way, Mrs Turpin.

Cut to Mrs Turpin sitting in a suburban lounge. A big sign saying 'Intercontinental Arrivals', in airport writing, hangs from the ceiling. Mr and Mrs Irrelevant arrive and sit down.

Mrs Turpin

Now, the duty-free trolley is over there ... there's some lovely drop scones and there's duty-free broccoli and there's fresh eccles cakes. You're allowed two hundred each on the plane.

Mrs Turpin

she picks up teacup and speaks into it

Mrs Turpin

The Verrifast Plane Company announce the departure of flight one to over the hills and far away. Will passengers for flight one, please assemble at gate one. Passengers are advised that there is still plenty of time to buy eccles cakes.

Man and vicar enter carrying a large wing.

Man

Nearly ready.

They take the wing through. Hammering is heard.

Mrs Turpin

speaking into cup

Mrs Turpin

All passengers please get ready for their barley sugar injections.

Japanese pilot comes in.

Kamikaze

Today we all take vow. Today we smash the enemy fleet... we smash, smash.

Man and vicar grab him and take him back.

Mrs Turpin

That's Mr Kamikaze, the pilot, he's very nice really, but make sure he stays clear of battleships.

Cut to stock film of battleships, steaming on the seas. Stirring music plays over.

Voice Over

There have been many stirring tales told of the sea and also some fairly uninteresting ones only marginally connected with it, like this one. Sorry, this isn't a very good announcement. Sorry.

Cut from sea to announcer by his desk at the seaside.

Announcer

And here is the result of the 'Where to put Edward Heath's statue Competition. The winner was a Mr Ivy North who wins ten guineas and a visit to the Sailors Quarters.

Cut to quick clip of the Battle of Pearl Harbor from show eleven, first series. Beginning with Eric blowing the whistle and the two sides rushing at each other. Cut back to announcer.

Announcer

That was last year's re-enactment of the Battle of Pearl Harbor performed by the Batley Townswomen's Guild. It was written, directed and produced by Mrs Rita Fairbanks.

Cut to Rita Fairbanks on the beach.

Rita

Hello again.

Voice Over

And what are your ladies going to do for us this year?

Rita

Well, this year we decided to re-enact something with a more modern flavour. We had considered a version of Michael Stewart's speech on Nigeria and there were several votes on the Committee for a staging of Herr Willi Brandt's visit to East Germany, but we've settled instead for a dramatization of the first heart transplant. Incidentally my sister Madge will be playing the plucky little springbok pioneer Christian Barnard.

Voice Over

Well off we go, then with the Barley Townswomen's Guild re-enactment of the first heart transplant.

Rita Fairbanks blows her whistle. The two groups of ladies rush at each other. They end up in the sea, rolling about splashing, and thumping each other with handbags.

Announcer

his desk now surrounded by sea

Announcer

The first heart transplant. But this is not the only open-air production here that has used the sea. Theatrical managers in this area have not been slow to appreciate the sea's tremendous dramatic value. And somewhere, out in this bay, is the first underwater production of 'Measure for Measure'.

Expanse of sea water. Dubbed over this is muffled, watery Shakespearian blank verse. We zoom in. Two Shakespearian actors (Terry J and Michael) leap up. They take a deep breath and go under again. The dialogue carries on muted. Pull out to see a rowboat. Shakespearian characters are sitting there waiting for their cue. One of the two characters leaps up and shouts:

Character

Servant ho!

He then goes underwater again. The servant in the boat steps into the water and goes under. Cut to announcer, now up to his waist in sea.

Announcer

The underwater version of 'Measure for Measure', and further out to sea 'Hello Dolly' is also doing good business.

We see a buoy, on the top of which is a stiff piece of card which reads 'Hello Dolly, Tonight 7.30'. There is a muffled watery snatch of Hello Dolly. Swing round to a patch of open sea.

Announcer

... and over there on the oyster beds Formula 2 car racing.

Arrow indicates the tuning dial. Pull back. Two women are listening to the set. The announcer continues from the radio set.

Announcer's Voice

...and that concludes the week's episode of 'How to Recognize Different Parts of the Body', adapted for radio by Ann Haydon-Jones and her husband, Pip. And now we present the first episode of a new radio drama series, 'The Death of Mary, Queen of Scots.' Part One: The Beginning.

Theme music. 'Coronation Scot' as used in 'Paul Temple' for years.

Man's Voice

You are Mary, Queen of Scots?

Woman's voice

I am!

There now follows a series of noises indicating that Mary is getting the shit knocked out of her. Thumps, bangs, slaps, pneumatic drilling, sawing, flogging, shooting, all interlaced with Mary's screams. The two women listen calmly. After a few seconds: fade as the signature tune 'Coronation Scot' is brought up loudly to denote ending of episode.

Radio Announcer

Episode two of 'The Death of Mary, Queen of Scots', can be heard on Radio 4 almost immediately.

One of the women goes over to the set and switches it over. As she goes back to her seat from the radio we hear the theme music again, fading out as the sounds of violence and screaming start again and continue unabated in vigour.

Man's Voice

I think she's dead.

Woman's voice

No I'm not!

After a time, sounds of violence and screaming start again rapidly fading under the tune of 'Coronation Scot'.

Announcer's Voice

That was episode two of 'The Death of Mary, Queen of Scots', adapted for radio by Bernard Hollowood and Brian London. And now, Radio Four will explode.

Announcer's Voice

the radio explodes

First Pepperpot

We'll have to watch the telly then.

Second Pepperpot

Yes

The pepperpots swivel round to look at the TV set in the corner of the room.

First Pepperpot

What's that on the tellevision then?

Second Pepperpot

Looks like a penguin.

On the TV set there is indeed a penguin. It sits contendedly looking at them in a stuffed sort of way. There is nothing on the screen.

First Pepperpot

No, no, no, I didn't mean what's on the television set, I meant what programme.

Second Pepperpot

Oh.

The second pepperpot goes to the TV, switches it on and returns to her chair. The set takes a long time to warm up and produce a picture. During this pause the following conversation takes place:

Second Pepperpot

It's funny that penguin being there innit? What's it doing there?

First Pepperpot

Standing.

Second Pepperpot

I can see that!

First Pepperpot

If it lays an egg, it will fall down the back of the television set.

Second Pepperpot

We'll have to watch that. Unless it's a male.

First Pepperpot

Ooh, I never thought of that.

Second Pepperpot

Yes, looks fairly butch.

First Pepperpot

Per'aps it's from next door.

Second Pepperpot

Penguins don't come from next door, they come from the Antarctic.

First Pepperpot

Burma.

Second Pepperpot

Why did say Burma?

First Pepperpot

I panicked.

Second Pepperpot

Oh. Perhaps it's from the zoo.

First Pepperpot

Which zoo?

Second Pepperpot

How should I know which zoo? I'm not Doctor bloody Bernowski.

First Pepperpot

How does Doctor Bernowski know which zoo it came from?

Second Pepperpot

He knows everything.

First Pepperpot

Oooh, I wouldn't like that, that'd take all the mystery out of life. Anyway, if it came from the zoo, it would have 'property of the zoo' stamped on it.

Second Pepperpot

No it wouldn't. They don't stamp animals 'property of the zoo'. You can't stamp a huge lion.

First Pepperpot

They stamp them when they're small.

Second Pepperpot

What happens when they moult?

First Pepperpot

Lions don't moult.

Second Pepperpot

No, but penguins do. There, I've run rings around you logically.

First Pepperpot

Oh, intercourse the penguin.

On the TV screen there now appears an announcer.

TV Announcer

It's just gone 8 o'clock and time for the penguin on top of your television set to explode.

The penguin on top of the set now explodes.

First Pepperpot

How did he know that was going to happen?!

TV Announcer

It was an inspired guess. And now...

Inspector Muffin the Mule bursts through the door.

Muffin

All right, don't anybody move, there's been a murder.

Mother

A murder?

Burnley - that's right! Burnley in Lancashire. There's been a Burnley.

Son

Burglary.

Muffin

Burglary. Yes, good man. Burglary - that's it, of course. There's been a burglary.

Doctor

Where?

Muffin

In the back, just below the rib.

Doctor

No - that's murder.

Muffin

Oh... er no... in the band... In the bat... Barclays bat.

Son

Barclays Bank?

Muffin

Yes. Nasty business - got away with £23,000.

Son

Any clues?

Muffin

Any what?

Son

Any evidence as to who did it?

Muffin

sarcastically

Muffin

Any clues, eh? Oh, we don't half talk posh, don't we? I suppose you say 'ehnvelope' and 'larngerie' and 'sarndwiches on the settee'! Well this is a murder investigation, young man, and murder is a very serious business.

Doctor

I thought you said it was a burglary.

Muffin

Burglary is almost as serious a business as murder. Some burglaries are more serious than murder. A burglary in which someone gets stabbled is murder! So don't come these petty distinctions with me. You're as bad as a judge. Right, now! The first thing to do in the event of a breach of the peace of any kind, is to... go...

Muffin

pause

Muffin

and ... oh, sorry, sorry, I was miles away.

Doctor

Ring the police?

Muffin

Ring the police. Yes, that's a good idea. Get them over here fast ... no, on second thoughts, get them over here slowly, so they don't drop anything.

Mother

Shall I make us all a cup of tea?

Muffin

Make what you like, Boskovitch - it won't help you in court.

Mother

I

Mother

beg

Mother

your pardon?

Muffin

I'm sorry, sorry. That's the trouble with being on two cases at once. I keep thinking I've got Boskovitch cornered and in fact I'm investigating a Burnley.

Muffin

Burglary! Yes - good man.

Sound of police siren and sound of cars drawing up outside.

Doctor

Who's Boskovitch?

Muffin

Hah! Boskovitch is a Russian scientist who is passing information to the Russians.

Son

Classified information?

Muffin

Oh, there he goes again! 'Classified information'! Oh, sitting on the 'settee' with our 'scones' and our 'classified information'!

The door opens and a plainclothes detective plus ten PCs (the Fred Tomlinson Singers) enter.

Muffin

Ah! Hello, Duckie.

Duckie

Hello, sir. How are you?

Muffin

I'm fine thanks. How are you?

Duckie

Well, sir, I'm a little bit moody today, sir.

Brian Distel and Brianette Zatapathique there in an improvised scene from Jean Kenneth Longueur's new movie 'Le Fromage Grand'. Brian and Brianette symbolize the breakdown in communication in our modern society in this exciting new film and Longueur is saying to us, his audience, 'go on, protest, do something about it, assault the manager, demand your money back'. Later on in the film, in a brilliantly conceived montage, Longueur mercilessly exposes the violence underlying our society when Brian and Brianerte again meet on yet another rubbish dump.

Isn't it a bit of a drawback that there's no snow here?

Schlick

Well, we have 28,000 cubic feet of Wintrex, which is a new white foam rubber which actually on screen looks more like snow than snow...

Cut to shot of people nailing and sticking white foam rubber over things. It looks terrible. Others are painting the sand with white paint.

Schlick

... and 1,600 cubic US furlongs of white paint, with a special snow finish.

Conger

And I believe Kirk Vilb is playing the title role.

Schlick

That is correct. We were very thrilled and honoured when Kirk agreed to play the part of Lieutenant Scott

Schlick

cut to Kirk Vilb who is wearing fur open at the chest; he is having a chest wig stuck on and icing sugar squeezed on to his nose and eyebrows

Schlick

cut back to Gerry Schlick and Chris Conger

Schlick

And directing we have a very fine young British director, James McRettin, who's been collaborating on the screenplay, of course Jimmy...

McRettin rushes into foreground. He is in no way like J. McGrath.

McRettin

Oh, there you are. Hello. Hello. No problem. Have a drink. Have a drink. Great. Hello. Marvellous. Marvellous. Hello. Rewrite. Oh this is really great. I mean, it's really saying something, don't you think?

Conger

Have you started shooting yet?

McRettin

Yes, yes. Great. Perfect. No, no, we haven't started yet. No. But great - great.

Conger

What is the first scene that you shoot this morning?

McRettin

Great. Terrific. Oh it's great. No problem. We'll sort it out on the floor. Sort it out on the floor. No problem. This film is basically pro-humanity and anti-bad things and it rips aside the hypocritical facade of our society's gin and tonic and leaves a lot of sacred cows rolling around in agony, have a drink, have a drink.

Conger

But which

Conger

scene

Conger

are we shooting first, Jimmy?

McRettin

Yes, great. Oh, marvellous.

McRettin

calls out

McRettin

to Conger

McRettin

calls.

McRettin

I thought we cut that? Didn't we cut that?

Schlick

No, we didn't.

McRettin

We didn't. Oh great. That's even better. I'll put it back in. Rewrite.

McRettin

calling

McRettin

This is the scene - outside the tent - it's all bloody marvelous. It makes you want to throw up.

Cut to Schlick and Conger on the beach.

Schlick

Now in this scene Lieutenant Scott returns to camp in the early morning after walking the huskies to have brunch with the rest of his team.

Schlick

cut to shot of tent with Bowers, who is black, and Oates, sitting outside

Schlick

Oates, played by your very own lovely Terence Lemming, who is an English cockney officer seconded to the US Navy, and Bowers played by Seymour Fortescue, the Olympic pole vaulter.

Film: Scott comes up to them. He has two large boxes strapped to his feet to make him look tall.

Oates

Hi, Lieutenant.

Scott

Hi, Oatesy. Sure is a beautiful day already.

McRettin

rushing in

McRettin

Great, great.

Scott

What? What are you saying?

McRettin

I was just saying great, great. Cue Evans.

Sexy girl with long blond hair comes into shot with short pink fur coat. She walks up to Scott who towers four feet above her as she is walking in a trench.

Schlick

And this is Vanilla Hoare as Miss Evans.

Conger

Miss Evans?

Schlick

Right.

Miss Evans is now beneath Scott at knee height.

Scott

Good morning, Miss Evans.

Evans

Oh, I've forgotten my line.

McRettin

What's her line? What's her line?

Girl runs in with script.

Girl

It's 'Good morning, Captain Scott'.

Evans

Oh, yeah. 'Good morning, Captain Sc'..; oh, I'm just not really very happy with that line. Could I just say 'Hi Scottie'?

McRettin

Great. Great. Rewrite. Cue.

Evans

Hi Scarrie! Oh, sorry. Hi Stocky! Oh - I'm sorry again. Oh, Jim. I'm just unhappy with this line. Hey, can I do it all sort of kooky, like this?

Evans

goes beserk waving hands

Evans

Hi Scottie!

McRettin

Great! We'll shoot it.

Scott

Are you sure that's right?

McRettin

Oh, it's great.

Gerry Schlick walks into the shot.

Schlick

Jim.

McRettin

Jim! Jim! Oh, me!

Schlick

Jim, I feel we may be running into some problems here in the area of height.

McRettin

Great! Where are they?

Schlick

Where are who?

McRettin

I don't know. I was getting confused.

Schlick

Jim, I feel here, that Scott may be too tall in the area of height with reference to Vanilla who is too near the ground in the area of being too short at this time.

McRettin

Great ... Oh, I know. I'm going to dig a pit for Scott and put a box in Vanilla's trench.

Scott

Say, why don't I take the boxes off and Vanilla get up out of the trench?

McRettin

It wouldn't work... It's even better! Great. Rewrite!

Evans

What was that?

McRettin

Oh, it's easy. I've worked it out. Scott takes his boxes off and you don't stand in the trench.

Evans

I say my lines out of the trench?

McRettin

Even better. Great.

Evans

But I've never acted out of a trench. I might fall over. It's dangerous.

McRettin

Oh well, could you just try it?

Evans

Look, you crumb bum, I'm a star. Star, star, star. I don't get a million dollars to act out of a trench. I played Miss St John the Baptist in a trench,

Evans

she walks along in the trench and we see that she has two boxes strapped to her feet

Evans

walks off

Evans

I played Miss Galileo in a groove and I played Mrs Jesus Christ in a geological syncline, so don't...

McRettin

Great. Great everyone. Lunch now. Lunch. It's all in the can. Good morning's work.

Schlick

But you haven't done a shot.

McRettin

Just keeping morale up.

McRettin

tries to take a drink from his view finder

The same afternoon.

Schlick

Now this afternoon we're going to shoot the scene where Scott gets off the boat on to the ice floe and he sees the lion and he fights it and kills it and the blood goes pssssssssshhh in slow motion.

Conger

But there aren't any lions in the Antarctic.

Schlick

What?

Conger

There aren't any lions in the Antarctic.

Schlick

You're right. There are no lions in the Antarctic. That's ridiculous! Whoever heard of a lion in the Antarctic? Right. Lose the lion.

McRettin

Got to keep the lion. It's great!

Schlick

Lose the lion.

McRettin

Great. We're losing the lion. Rewrite. Lose the lion everyone. That's fantastic.

Scott

What's this about our losing the lion?

Schlick

Well, Kirk, we thought perhaps we might lose the fight with the lion a little bit, Kirk, angel.

Scott

loudly

Scott

Why?

Schlick

Well, Kirkie, doll, there are no lions in the Antarctic, baby.

Scott

shouts

Scott

I get to fight the lion.

Schlick

It'd be silly.

Scott

Listen, I gotta fight the lion. That's what that guy Scott's all about. I know. I've studied him already.

Schlick

But why couldn't you fight a penguin?

McRettin

Great!

McRettin

falls over

Scott

Fight a rotten penguin?

Schlick

It needn't be a little penguin. It can be the biggest penguin you've ever seen. An electric penguin, twenty feet high, with long green tentacles that sting people, and you can stab it in the wings and the blood can go spurting psssssshhhh in slow motion.

Scott

The lion is in the contract.

Schlick

He fights the lion.

McRettin

Even better. Great. Have a drink. Lose the penguin. Stand by to shoot.

Schlick

Where do they have lions?

Conger

Africa.

Schlick

That's it. Scott's in Africa. As many lions as we need.

Schlick

He's looking for a pole no one else knows about. That ties in with the sand. Right. Paint the sand yellow again. Okay, let's get this show on the road. 'Scott of the Sahara.'

Cut instantly to sky.

CAPTION: 'SCOTT OF THE SAHARA'

Voice Over

Booming out of the pages of history comes a story of three men and one woman whose courage shocked a generation.

Blinding sun. Pan down to Paignton beach. Scott, Evans, Oates and Bowers wearing furs crossing sand on snow shoes. With sledge pulled by motley selection of mongrel dogs, badly disguised as huskies.

Voice Over

From the same team that brought you ...

Voice Over

the names come out superimposed

Voice Over

'Lawrence of Glareorgan' ... 'Bridge Over the River Trent' ... 'The Mad Woman of Biggleswade' ... and 'Krakatoa, East of Leamington' ... comes the story of three people and a woman united by fate who set out in search of the fabled Pole of the Sahara and found ... themselves. See ... Lieutenant Scott's death struggle with a crazed desert lion.

The four are walking along. Suddenly they stop, stare, and react in horror. Scott steps to the front to defend the others. Intercut, non-matching stock shot of lion running out of jungle and leaping at camera. Scott waits poised and is then struck by completely rigid stuffed lion. Montage of shots of him wrestling, firstly with the stuffed lion, then with an actor in a tatty lion suit. The lion picks up a chair, fends Scott off, smashes it over his head. Finally Scott kicks the lion on the shin. The lion leaps around on one leg and picks up a knife. Scott points, the lion looks, Scott kicks the knife out of the lion's paw. He advances on the lion, and socks him on the jaw. The lion collapses in slow motion. After a pause, phoney blood spurts out.

Voice Over

See Ensign Oates' frank adult death struggle with the spine-chilling giant electric penguin...

Oates looks up in horror, a shadow crosses him. Reverse shot of model penguin (quite small, about a foot) which lights up and looks electric. The penguin is close to the camera in the foreground and appears huge. Oates looks around desperately then starts to undress. Shot of penguin throwing tentacle. Half-nude Oates struggles with it. Intercut a lot of phoney reverses. Oates by now clad only in posing briefs sees a stone. He picks up the stone, then camera zooms into above-naval shot; he removes his briefs, puts the stone in the briefs, twirls it like a sling, and releases stone. The penguin is hit on beak, and falls over backwards.

Voice Over

... See Miss Evans pursued by the man-eating roll-top writing desk.

Miss Evans is running along screaming. Shot of desk chasing her (phoney desk with man inside). The roll top goes up and down, emitting roars, and displaying fearsome white teeth inside. As Evans runs, her clothing gets torn on each of the three cactuses. These are well spaced apart so that there is a lot of trouble to get near them. When she is practically nude, she runs out of shot revealing the announcer.

Announcer

And now for something completely different.

It's Man

It's...

ANIMATION:

dancing teeth. Then animation of a letter being resealed and posted - all backwards - ending in a real post office.

A post office worker removes the stamp from the letter and hands it to man.

Post Office Worker

Five pence please.

The man walks out backwards, pasing Mr Praline as he enters. He looks at the man, puzzled, and then goes up to first of two grils which has a sign saying 'stamps and licences'.

Praline

Excuse me, I would like to buy a fish license, please.

Praline

the man behind the counter points to next grille; to camera

Praline

he goes to next grille

Praline

Hello, I would like to buy a fish licence, please.

Man

A what?

Praline

A license for my pet fish, Eric.

Man

How did you know my name was Eric?

Praline

No no no, my

Praline

fish's

Praline

name is Eric, Eric the fish. 'E's an 'alibut.

Praline

He is an halibut.

Man

You've got a pet halibut?

Praline

Yes. I chose him out of thousands. I didn't like the others, they were all too flat.

Man

You must be a loony.

Praline

I am not a looney! Why should I be tied with the epithet looney merely because I have a pet halibut? I've heard tell that Sir Gerald Nabardo has a pet prawn called Simon and you wouldn't call him a looney; furthermore, Dawn Pailthorpe, the lady show-jumper, had a clam, called Stafford, after the late Chancellor, Allan Bullock has two pikes, both called Chris, and Marcel Proust had an haddock! So, if you're calling the author of 'A la recherche du temps perdu' a looney, I shall have to ask you to step outside!

Man

All right, all right, all right. You want a licence.

Praline

Yes.

Man

For a fish.

Man

You

Man

are

Man

a loony.

Praline

Look, it's a bleeding pet, isn't it? I've got a license for me pet dog Eric, and I've got a license for me pet cat Eric...

Man

You don't need a license for a cat.

Praline

I bleeding well do and I got one. Ho, ho, you're not catching me out there.

Man

There's no such thing as a bloody cat license.

Praline

Yes there is!

Man

No there isn't!

Praline

Is!

Man

Isn't!

Praline

What's that then?

Man

This is a dog license with the word 'dog' crossed out and the word 'cat' written in in crayon.

Praline

The man didn't have the proper form.

Man

What man?

Praline

The man from the cat detector van.

Man

Loony detector van, you mean.

Praline

It's people like you what cause unrest.

Man

All right, what cat detector van?

Praline

The cat detector van from the Ministry of Housinge.

Man

Housinge?

Praline

It was spelt like that on the van. I'm very observant!. I never seen so many bleeding aerials. The man said that their equipment could pinpoint a purr at four hundred yards...and Eric, being such a happy cat, was a piece of cake.

Man

How much did you pay for this?

Praline

Sixty quid, and eight guineas for the fruit bat.

Man

What fruit bat?

Praline

Eric the fruit-bat.

Man

Are all your pets called Eric?

Praline

There's nothing so odd about that: Kemal Ataturk had an entire menagerie, all called Abdul!

Man

No he didn't!

Praline

takes book from pocket

Praline

He did, he did, he did, he did and did. There you are. 'Kemal Ataturk, the Man' by E. W. Swanton with a foreword by Paul Anka, page 91, please.

Man

referring to page 91

Man

I owe you an apology, sir.

Praline

Spoken like a gentleman, sir. Now, are you going to give me a fish license?

Man

I promise you that there is no such thing. You don't need one.

Praline

Then I would like a statement to that effect signed by the Lord Mayor.

Fanfare of trumpets. Mayor gorgeously dressed with dignitaries enters flanked by trumpeters.

Man

You're in luck.

In long shot now. The Mayor, who is nine foot high, and dignitaries approach a startled Praline. Organ music below a reverent voice over:

Voice Over

And now, there is the Mayor. Surely the third tallest mayor in Derby's history. And there are the Aldermen magnificently resplendent in their Aldermanic hose and just look at the power in those thighs. The New Zealanders are going to find it pretty tough going in the set pieces in the second half... So Dawn Palethorpe with one clear round on Sir Gerald... and now the Mayor has reached the Great Customer Mr Eric Praline.

Voice Over

the mayor takes a piece of Paper from the post office man

Voice Over

the mayor signs it and hands it to Praline

Voice Over

Praline looks very confused

Voice Over

has finally gone spare and there is the going sparal look on the front of his head. And now the Aldermen are finishing their oranges and leaving the post office for the start of the second half.

They all exit out of door, eating oranges, and Praline looks after them. Cut to a rugby field. Crowd roaring as the aldermen, mayor, mayoress, town clerk, Dawn Palethorpe (on a horse) and the borough surveyor run onto the pitch and take up their positions.

Commentator

And here come the Derby Council XV following the All Blacks out on to the pitch. There, in the centre of the picture you can see Dawn Palethorpe on Sir Gerald - one of the fastest wingers we must have seen in England this season. On the left hand side of the picture the Lord Mayor has been running such wonderful possession for Derby Council in the lines out and it's the All Blacks to kick off. Wilson to kick off. Oh, I can see there the Chairman of the By-ways and Highways Committee who's obviously recovered from that very nasty blow he got in that loose ball in the first half.

Commentator

opposite them the All Blacks kick off

Commentator

And Wilson kicks off and it's the Town Clerk's taken the ball beautifully there, the All Blacks are up on it very fast and the whistle has gone. I'm not quite sure what happened there, I couldn't see, but there's a scrum-down. I think it's an All Blacks' ball. They were upon them very fast. Obviously they're going to try very hard in this half to wipe out this five-point deficit. Derby Council eight points to three up and Derby Council have got the ball against the head. There is the Borough Surveyor, the scrum-half is out of the ... er, the Chairman of the Highway and By-way Committee who's kicked for touch. The line out - and it's into the line out and the Mayor has got the ball again. To the Borough Surveyor who's left out the Medical Officer of Health. Straight along the line to the Lady Mayoress and the Lady Mayoress has got to go through. Number two has missed her - he's taken to the full back - only the full back to beat and she has scored! The Lady Mayoress has scored, it's eleven points to three.

CAPTION: 'NEW ZEALAND 3 DERBY COUNCIL 11'

Cut to linkman and Cliff Morgan.

Linkman

Cliff, this must have been a very disappointing result for the All Blacks.

Cliff

Welsh

Cliff

Well, they've had very bad luck on the tour so far. They missed four very easy kicks against the Exeter Amateur Operatic Society, which must have cost them the match and then of course there was that crippling defeat at the hands of the Derry and Toms Soft Toy Department, so I don't think they can be really fancying their chances against the London Pooves on Saturday.

Linkman

And what about China?

Cliff

Well, whether Mao Tse Tung is alive or not, Lin Piao has a stranglehold on the central committee which Lin Shao Chi can't break, so it remains to be seen whether Chou En Lai can really get his finger out and get going in the second half.

Linkman

Well, thank you Cliff. Tonight's other outstanding match was the semi-final between the Bournemouth Gynaecologists and the Watford Long John Silver Impersonators. We bring you edited highlights of the match.

Rapid montage of goals scored by competent gynaecologists wearing surgical gowns and caps, against totally incompetent and immobile LJSI team who simply stand round going 'aaah! Jim lad' as the goals rain in. The ball is tucked off-screen. Sudden cut to studio. A presenter is standing in front of curtain; he catches the ball thrown from off. He smiles.

Presenter

Well, that's about it for tonight ladies and gentlemen, but remember if you've enjoyed watching the show just half as much as we've enjoyed doing it, then we've enjoyed it twice as much as you. Ha, ha, ha.

The sixteen-ton weight falls on him. Cut to montage of scenes of destruction, buildings falling down, bombs etc. Roll credits over.

An office. Boss is reading a book, 'Chinese for Business Men'. He tries out a few Chinese words. There is a knock at the door.

Boss

Come in.

Boss

Mr Frog comes in

Boss

Ah, Frog.

Frog

S. Frog, sir.

Boss

Shut up, I want to have a word with you, Frog.

Boss

Shut up. It's about your advertising campaign for Conquistador Coffee. Now, I've had the managing director of Conquistador to see me this morning and he's very unhappy with your campaign. Very unhappy. In fact, he's shot himself.

Frog

Badly, sir?

Boss

No, extremely well.

Boss

Boss

Shut up. Why did you do it?

Frog

It was a joke.

Boss

A joke?

Boss

holds up card saying 'joke'

Frog

No, no not a joke, a sales campaign.

Frog

holds up a card saying 'No, a Sales Campaign'

Boss

I see, Frog.

Boss

Shut up. Now, let's have a look at the sales chart.

Boss

indicates a plummeting sales graph

Boss

When you took over this account, Frog, Conquistador was a brand leader. Here you introduced your first campaign, 'Conquistador Coffee brings a new meaning to the word vomit'. Here you made your special introductory offer of a free dead dog with every jar, and this followed your second campaign 'the tingling fresh coffee which brings you exciting new cholera, mange, dropsy, the clap, hard pad and athlete's head. From the House of Conquistador'.

Frog

It was a soft-sell, sir

Boss

Why, Frog?

Boss

Shut up! Well?

Frog

Well, people know the name, sir.

Boss

They certainly do know the name - they burnt the factory down. The owner is hiding in my bathroom

Boss

Boss

holds up 'joke' card again

Frog

You're not going to fire me, sir?

Boss

Fire you? Three men dead, the factory burnt down, the account lost and our firm completely bankrupt, what... what... what ... can you possibly say? What excuse can you possibly make?

Frog

Sorry, father.

Frog

holds up the 'joke' card

Boss

Oh, yes. Oh, incidentally your film's won a prize.

He opens a venetian blind on the window to reveal the film: a coastline. Panning shot of hills rolling down into the sea, waves breaking on the shore. Travelogue music. Suddenly the music sticks, and keeps repeating one phrase. The pan continues. We come across an old-fashioned gramophone on which the record is sticking. A hand comes in and lifts the needle off. The pan continues - it's the hand of the announcer who is sitting at his desk.

Announcer

Sorry about that. And now for something completely diff...

Announcer

the film sticks and repeats the end of the sentence several times

Announcer

something completely diff... completely diff... completely diff... completely diff... completely different.

I'll throw that in and a fiver, for the briefcase and the umbrella ... no, make it fair, the briefcase and the umbrella and the two pens in your breast pocket and the chair's yours and a fiver and a pair of ex-German U-boat commander's binoculars.

Bee

Really, they are not for sale.

Glans

Not for sale, what does that mean?

Bee

Oh, John, thank you... anyway you could always catch the 9.30 tomorrow - it goes via Caterham and Chipstead.

John

Or the 9.45's even better.

Jasmina

Oh, but you'd have to change at Lambs Green.

Yes, but there's only a seven-minute wait now.

Excellent, very good, delightful.

Tony runs in through the french windows. He wears white flannels and boater and is jolly upper-class.

Tony

Hello everyone.

All

Tony!

Tony

Where's daddy?

Tony

seeing him

Tony

Oh golly! Has he been... ?

John and Jasmina

Yes, after breakfast.

Tony

Then ... he won't be needing his reservation on the 10.15.

John

Exactly.

Tony

And I suppose as his eldest son it must go to me.

Inspector

Just a minute, Tony. There's a small matter of... murder.

Tony

Oh, but surely he simply shot himself and then hid the gun.

Lady Partridge

How could anyone shoot himself and then hide the gun without first cancelling his reservation.

Tony

Ha, ha! Well, I must dash or I'll be late for the 10.15.

Inspector

I suggest you murdered your father for his seat reservation.

Tony

I may have had the motive, inspector, but I could not have done it, for I have only just arrived from Gillingham on the 8.13 and here's my restaurant car ticket to prove it.

Jasmina

The 8.13 from Gillingham doesn't have a restaurant car.

John

It's a standing buffet only.

Tony

Oh, er... did I say the 8.13, I meant the 7.58 stopping train.

Lady Partridge

But the 7.58 stopping train arrived at Swindon at 8.19 owing to annual point maintenance at Wisborough Junction.

John

So how did you make the connection with the 8.13 which left six minutes earlier?

Tony

Oh, er, simple! I caught the 7.16 Football Special arriving at Swindon at 8.09.

Jasmina

But the 7.16 Football Special only stops at Swindon on alternate Saturdays.

Lady Partridge

Yes, surely you mean the Holidaymaker Special.

Tony

Oh, yes! How daft of me. Of course, I came on the Holidaymaker Special calling at Bedford, Colmworth, Fen Dinon, Sutton, Wallington and Gillingham.

Inspector

That's Sundays only!

Tony

Damn. All right, I confess I did it. I killed him for his reservation, but you won't take me alive! I'm going to throw myself under the 10.12 from Reading.

John

Don't be a fool, Tony, don't do it, the 10.12 has the new narrow traction bogies, you wouldn't stand a chance.

Tony

Exactly.

Tableau. Loud chord and slow curtain.

Voice Over

That was an excerpt from the latest West End hit 'It all happened on the 11.20 from Hainault to Redhill via Horsham and Reigate, calling at Carshalton Beeches, Malmesbury, Tooting Bec, and Croydon West'. The author is Mr. Neville Shunt.

Shunt sitting among mass of railway junk, at typewriter, typing away madly.

Shunt

Chuff, chuff, chuffwoooooch, woooooch! Sssssssss, sssssssss! Diddledum, diddledum, diddlealum. Toot, toot. The train now standing at platform eight, tch, tch, tch, diddledum, diddledum. Chuffff chuffffiTff eeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaa Vooooommmmm.

Cut to art critic.

SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'GAVIN MILLARRRRRRRRRR'

Art Critic

Some people have made the mistake of seeing Shunt's work as a load of rubbish about railway timetables, but clever people like me, who talk loudly in restaurants, see this as a deliberate ambiguity, a plea for understanding in a mechanized world. The points are frozen, the beast is dead. What is the difference? What indeed is the point? The point is frozen, the beast is late out of Paddington. The point is taken. If La Fontaine's elk would spurn Tom Jones the engine must be our head, the dining car our oesophagus, the guard's van our left lung, the cattle truck our shins, the first-class compartment the piece of skin at the nape of the neck and the level crossing an electric elk called Simon. The clarity is devastating. But where is the ambiguity? It's over there in a box. Shunt is saying the 8.15 from Gillingham when in reality he means the 8.13 from Gillingham. The train is the same only the time is altered. Ecce homo, ergo elk. La Fontaine knew his sister and knew her bloody well. The point is taken, the beast is moulting, the fluff gets up your nose. The illusion is complete; it is reality, the reality is illusion and the ambiguity is the only truth. But is the truth, as Hitchcock observes, in the box? No there isn't room, the ambiguity has put on weight. The point is taken, the elk is dead, the beast stops at Swindon, Chabrol stops at nothing, I'm having treatment and La Fontaine can get knotted.

Cut to late-night line-up setting. Interviewer and interviewee.

Padget

Martin Curry, welcome. One of the big teeth... big points that the American critics made about your latest film, 'The Twelve Caesars', was that it was on so all-embracing a topic. What made you undertake so enormous a tusk... task?

We now see that his interviewee has two enormous front teeth.

Curry

Well I've always been interested in Imperial Rome from Julius Caesar right through to Vethpathian.

Padget

Who?

Curry

Vethpathian.

Padget

Ah! Vespasian.

Curry

Yes.

Padget

When I saw your film it did seem to me that you had taken a rather, umm, subjective approach to it.

Curry

I'm sorry?

Padget

Well, I mean all your main characters had these enormous ... well not enormous, these very big ... well let's have a look at a clip in which Julius Incisor .... Caesar talks to his generals during the battle against Caractacus.

Back to interview set.

Padget

Martin Curry, why do all your characters have these very big er ... very big um ... teeth?

Curry

What do you mean?

Padget

Well, I mean, er... and even in your biblical epic, 'The Son of Man', John the Baptist had the most enormous ... dental appendages ... and of course ... himself had the most monumental ivories.

Curry

No, I'm afraid I don't see that at all.

Curry

Padget

Oh, a straw, yes, yes. Well while we're doing that perhaps we could take another look at an earlier film, 'Trafalgar'.

Between decks. Nelson lying among others. They all have enormous teeth.

Nelson

Cover my coat, Mr Bush, the men must not know of this till victory is ours.

Toad

The surgeon's coming, sir.

No, tell the surgeon to attend the men that can be saved. He can do little for me, I fear.

Toad

Aye, aye, sir.

Cut to a person in church. They are walking past a pillar. They take out some money and put it in a collecting box. A sign on the box says 'For the rich'. We hear the money going in, then it moves off, along pipes, falling down; eventually it comes down a small pipe and lands with a tinkle in Crackpot's ashtray. He tries the money with his teeth, pops it into his pocket, and finishes reading...

Crackpot

Crackpot

A lot of religions - no names no pack drill - do go for the poorer type of person - face it, there's more of 'em - poor people, thieves, villains, poor people without no money at all - well we don't have none of that. Rich people and crumpet over sixteen can enter free: upper middle class quite welcome; lower middle class not under five grand a year. Lower class - I can't touch it. There's no return on it, you see.

Mix through from flag to sea at night. Sound of water lapping. Soft sound of muffled oars drawing nearer. We can see a rowing boat making slowly and silently towards the shore where the camera is. The stirring music continues.

By the time roller captions have finished the rowing boat has approached much nearer. It stops and they ship their oars. Cut in to close ups of pirate's face peering into the darkness. Shot from the boat of a deserted cliff top. A light flashes twice. Then there is a pause. Cut back to the boat; the men look uneasy as they wait for the third flash. Cut back to the cliff...at last the third flash. Cut back to the boat; they start to again. Cut to them beaching the boat on the shore. They start to unload sacks and chests. Putting them onto their shoulders they start to walk along the shore line. We pan with them for quite some way...and suddenly between the camera and the pirates we come across the announcer at a desk. He wears a dinner jacket and shuffles some papers in front of him.

Karl nods

Presenter

You're a brave man. Karl Marx, your final question, who won the Cup Final in 1949?

Karl

The workers' control of the means of production? The struggle of the urban proletariat?

No. It was in fact, Wolverhampton Wanderers who beat Leicester 3-1.

Mix through to close up of a harmonica bring played by a British Tommy.

CAPTION: 'YPRES 1914'

The camera pulls slowly out, with the plaintive harmonica still playing, to reveal the interior of a bunker in the trenches. Sitting around on old ammunition boxes etc. are the harmonica player, Private Jenkins, Sergeant Jackson, a padre with no arms, a sheikh, a Viking warrior, a male mermaid, a nun, a milkman and a Greek Orthodox priest. Sounds of warfare throughout, shells thudding, explosions etc.

Sergeant

looking round rather uncomfortably at the strange collection

Sergeant

Jenkins?

Jenkins

equally uncomfortable about playing such a tender scene in front of sheiks etc.

Jenkins

Yes, sir.

Sergeant

What are you going to do when you get back to Blighty?

Jenkins

I dunno, sarge... I expect I'll be looking after me mum. She'll be getting on a bit now.

Sergeant

Got a family of your own 'ave you?

Jenkins

No, she's ... she's all I got left now. My wife, Doreen ... she ... I got a letter.

Sergeant

You don't have to tell me, son.

Jenkins

No, sarge, I'd like to tell you, see this place....

Cut to long shot of bunker. Floor manager strides on to set.

Floor Manager

cut to Che Guevara caught in a hot embrace with Karl Marx

Floor Manager

Sorry, camera four.

Cut to Art Gallery. A large sign says: 'Italian Masters of the Renaissance'. Two art critics wandering through. They stop in front of a large Titian canvas. The canvas is about ten foot high by six foot wide.

First Critic

Aren't they marvelous? The strength and boldness... life and power in those colours.

Second Critic

This must be Titian's masterpiece.

First Critic

Oh indeed - if only for the composition alone. The strength of those foreground figures ... the firmness of the line...

Second Critic

Yes, the confidence of the master at the height of his powers.

At this point a man in a country smock and straw hat and a straw in his mouth comes up to the painting and with a very businesslike manner presses the nipple of a nude in the painting. Ding dong sound of a front doorbell. He stands tapping his feet and whistling soundlessly beside the painting. He nods at the critics. Cut to the top of the painting to see that one of the figures has disappeared leaving a blank. The camera pans down the painting as we hear footsteps; as if coming down a lot of stone steps. Eventualy the camera comes to rest beside where the country bumpkin is standing and a door opens in the painting. We do, not see who has opened it, but can assume it is the cherub.

Cherub

Yes?

Bumpkin

Hello sonny, your dad in?

Cherub

Yes.

Bumpkin

Could I speak to him please? It's the man from 'The Hay Wain'.

Cherub

Who?

Bumpkin

The man from 'The Hay Wain' by Constable.

Cherub

Dad... it's the man from 'The Hay Wain' by Constable to see you.

Solomon

Coming.

Sound of footsteps. Cut to another close up on the painting and we see the main figure disappearing. This figure suddenly puts his head round the door.

Solomon

Hello? How are you? Come on in.

Bumpkin

No, no can't stop, just passing by, actually.

Solomon

Oh, where are you now?

Bumpkin

Well may you ask. We just been moved in next to a room full of Brueghels ... terrible bloody din. Skating all hours of the night. Anyway, I just dropped in to tell you there's been a walk-out in the Impressionists.

Solomon

Walk-out, eh?

Bumpkin

Yeah. It started with the 'Déjeuner Sur L'Herbe' lot, evidently they were moved away from above the radiator or something. Anyway, the Impressionists are all out. Gainsborough's Blue Boy's brought out the eighteenth-century English portraits, the Flemish School's solid, and the German woodcuts are at a meeting now.

Solomon

Right. Then I'll get the Renaissance School out.

Bumpkin

OK, meeting 4.30 - 'Bridge at Arles'.

Solomon

OK, cheerio - good luck, son.

Bumpkin

OK.

The door shuts and we hear Solomon's voice over.

Solomon

Right - everybody out.

We see various famous paintings whose characters suddenly disappear.

Voices

the man pauses for a moment and looks at radio, then resumes sawing; we zoom in to close up on the radio. There is a window behind it; as the radio talks, a group of paintings with picket signs pass by

Jenkins

No, sarge, I'd like to tell you. You see, this bloke from up the street...

Enter a young major.

Major

OK, chaps, at ease. I've just been up the line...

Sergeant

Can we get through, sir?

Major

No, I'm afraid we'll have to make a break for it at nightfall.

Sergeant

Right, sir. We're all with yer.

Major

Yes I know, that's just the problem, sergeant. How many are there of us?

Sergeant

Well there's you, me, Jenkins, Padre, Kipper, there's five, sir.

Major

And only rations for...

Sergeant

Four, sir.

Major

Precisely. I'm afraid one of us will have to take the 'other' way out.

Crash zoom into revolver which the major has brought out. Jarring chord. Close up of faces looking tense from one to the other. Tense music.

Padre

I'm a gonner, major. Leave me, I'm ... I'm not a complete man anymore.

Major

You've lost both your arms as well.

Padre

Yes. Damn silly really.

Major

No, no, we'll draw for it. That's the way we do things in the army. Sergeant, the straws!

The sergeant gives him the straws. The major arranges them and hands them round.

Major

Right now, the man who gets the shortest straw knows what to do

They all take the long straws. Including the padre who takes one in his teeth. The major is left with a tiny straw. A pause.

Sergeant

Looks like you, sir.

Major

Is it? What did we say, the longest straw was it?

Sergeant

No, shortest, sir.

Major

Well we'd better do it again, there's obviously been a bit of a muddle.

Major

they do it again and the same thing happens

Major

they go through it again and he gets left with it again

Major

he looks round to see if there are any takers

Major

counting out

Major

comes back to himself

Major

it's back on him again

Major

No, this is not working out. It's not working out. What shall we do?

Jenkins

How about one potato, two potato, sir?

Major

Don't be childish, Jenkins. No, I think, I think fisties would be best. OK, so hands behind backs. After three, OK, one, two, three.

Major

everyone except the padre who has no arms puts out clenched fist

Major

looks down at his hand

Major

and scissors. Now. Scissors cut everything, don't they?

Sergeant

Not stone, sir.

Major

They're very good scissors

Major

then he suddenly sees the padre

Major

Padre hasn't been!

Sergeant

No arms, sir.

Major

Oh, I'm terribly sorry, I'm afraid I didn't... tell you what. All those people who don't want to stay here and shoot themselves raise their arms.

Padre

Stop it! Stop it! Stop this ... this hideous façade.

Sergeant

Easy, padre!

Padre

No, no, I must speak. When I, when I came to this war, I had two arms, two good arms, but when the time came to... to lose one, I .. I gave it gladly, I smiled as they cut if off,

by this time he has disappeared in through the doors of the hospital

Richard III

A horse. A horse. My kingdom for a horse.

Specialist

Most of these cases are pretty unpleasant. Nurse...

Specialist

a nurse comes in and sedates Richard III

Specialist

But the treatment does work with some people. This chap came to us straight from the Chichester Festival; we operated just in time, and now he's almost normal.

He walks over to a very ordinary Richard III, who smiles disarmingly and says quite chatlily

Second Richard

A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse.

Shaking his head sadly, the specialist leaves the ward and opens a door to another one.

Specialist

But in here we have some very nasty cases indeed.

Announcer

Ladies and gentlemen, I am not simply going to say 'and now for something completely different' this week, as I do not think it fit. This is a particularly auspicious occasion for us this evening, as we have been told that Her Majesty the Queen will be watching part of the show tonight. We don't know exactly when Her Majesty will be tuning in. We understand that at the moment she is watching 'The Virginian', but we have been promised that we will be informed the moment that she changes channel. Her majesty would like everyone to behave quite normally but her equerry has asked me to request all of you at home to stand when the great moment arrives, although we here in the studio will be carrying on with our humorous vignettes and spoofs in the ordinary way. Thank you. And now without any more ado and completely as normal, here are the opening titles.

the story of such men, battling gallantly against floods, roof falls, the English criminal law, the hidden killer carbon monoxide and the ever-present threat of pneumoconiosis which is... a disease miners get.

Cut to coal face below ground where some miners are engaged at their work. They hew away for a bit, grunting and talking amongst themselves. Suddenly two of them square up to one another.

First Miner

Don't you talk to me like that, you lying bastard.

He hits the second miner and a fight starts.

Second Miner

You bleeding pig. You're not fit to be down a mine.

First Miner

Typical bleeding Rhondda, isn't it. You think you're so bloody clever.

They writhe around on the floor pummelling each other. The foreman comes in.

Foreman

You bloody fighting again. Break it up or I'll put this pick through your head. Now what's it all about?

First Miner

He started it.

Second Miner

Oh, you bleeding pig, you started it.

Foreman

I don't care who bloody started it. What's it about?

Second Miner

Well ... he said the bloody Treaty of Utrecht was 1713.

First Miner

So it bloody is.

Second Miner

No it bloody isn't. It wasn't ratified 'til February 1714.

First Miner

He's bluffing. You're mind's gone, Jenkins. You're rubbish.

Foreman

He's right, Jenkins. It was ratified September 1713. The whole bloody pit knows that. Look in Trevelyan, page 468.

Third Miner

He's thinking of the Treaty of bloody Westphalia.

Second Miner

Are you saying I don't know the difference between the War of the bloody Spanish Succession and the Thirty bloody Years War?

Third Miner

You don't know the difference between the Battle of Borodino and a tiger's bum.

They start to fight.

Foreman

Break it up, break it up.

Foreman

he hits them with his pickaxe

Foreman

I'm sick of all this bloody fighting. If it's not the bloody Treaty of Utrecht it's the bloody binomial theorem. This isn't the senior common room at All Souls, it's the bloody coal face.

A fourth miner runs up.

Fourth Miner

Hey, gaffer, can you settle something? Morgan here says you find the abacus between the triglyphs in the frieze section of the entablature of classical Greek Doric temples.

Foreman

You bloody fool, Morgan, that's the metope. The abacus is between the architrave and the aechinus in the capital.

Morgan

You stinking liar.

Another fight breaks out. A management man arrives carried in sedan chair by two black flunkies. He wears a colonial governor's helmet and a large sign reading 'frightfully important'. All the miners prostrate themselves on the floor.

Foreman

Oh, most magnificent and merciful majesty, master of the universe, protector of the meek, whose nose we are not worthy to pick and whose very feces are an untrammelled delight, and whose peacocks keep us awake all hours of the night with their noisy lovemaking, we beseech thee, tell thy humble servants the name of the section between the triglyphs in the frieze section of a classical Doric entablature.

Management Man

No idea. Sorry.

Foreman

Right. Everybody out.

They all walk off throwing down tools. Cut to a newsreader's desk.

Newsreader

Still no settlement in the coal mine dispute at Llanddarog. Miners refused to return to work until the management define a metope. Meanwhile, at Dagenham the unofficial strike committee at Fords have increased their demands to thirteen reasons why Henry III was a bad king. And finally, in the disgusting objects international at Wembley tonight, England beat Spain by a plate of braised pus to a putrid heron. And now, the Toad Elevating Moment.

Mr Pudifoot

Yes.

Interviewer

Have you always said things in a very roundabout way?

Interviewer

Well, I can't help noticing that, for someone who claims to say things in a very roundabout way, your last two answers have very little of the discursive quality about them.

Mr Pudifoot

Oh, well, I'm not very talkative today. It's a form of defensive response to intensive interrogative stimuli. I used to get it badly when I was a boy ... well, I say very badly, in fact, do you remember when there was that fashion for, you know, little poodles with small coats...

Interviewer

Ah, now you're beginning to talk in a roundabout way.

Mr Pudifoot

Oh, I'm sorry.

Interviewer

No, no, no, no. Please do carry on ... because that is in fact why we wanted you on the show.

Adman

Well last week on Fish Club we learnt how to sex a pike ... and this week we're going to learn how to feed a goldfish. Now contrary to what most people think the goldfish has a ravenous appetite. If it doesn't get enough protein it gets very thin and its bones begin to stick out and its fins start to fall off. So once a week give your goldfish a really good meal. Here's one specially recommended by the board of Irresponsible People. First, some cold consommé or a gazpacho

Mix in the sound of lovers - the indistinct deep voice, followed by a playful giggle from the girl. At first very distant, but as we continue to pan it increases in volume, until we come to rest on the source of the noise - a tape recorder in front of a bush. After a short paase, the camera tracks round behind this bush where are a couple sitting reading a book each. Pan away from them across afield. In the middle of the pan we come across a smooth, moustachioed little Italian head waiter, in tails etc. We do not stop on him.

The camera pans to the end of the field where we pick up a man in a long mac crawling on all fours through the undergrowth. We follow him as he occasionaly dodges behind a bush or a tree. He is stealthily tracking something. After a few moments he comes up behind a birdwatcher

in deerstalker and tweeds

who lies at the top of a small rise, with his binoculars trained. With infinite caution the man in the long mac slides up behind the birdwatcher, then he stretches out a hand and opens the flap of the birdwatcher's knapsack. He pulls out a small white paper bag. Holding his breath, he feels inside the bag and produces a small pie, then a tomato and finally two hard-boiled eggs. He pockets the hard-boiled eggs, puts the rest back and creeps away.

Voice Over

Herbert Mental collects birdwatchers' eggs. At his home in Surrey he has a collection of over four hundred of them.

Cut to mantle in a study lined with shelves full of hard-boiled eggs. They all have little labels on the front of them. He goes up and selects one from a long line of identical hard-boiled eggs.

Herbert

'Ere now. This is a very interesting one. This is from a Mr P. F. Bradshaw. He is usually found in Surrey hedgerows, but I found this one in the gents at St Pancras, uneaten.

Herbert

he provides the next question himself in bad ventriloquist style

Herbert

normal voice

Herbert

ventriloquially

Herbert

he moves to his left; on the wall behind him are the splayed-out figures of two butterfly hunters, with pins through their backs and their names on cards underneath

Herbert

Nice little chaps. But the hobby I enjoyed most was racing pigeon fanciers.

An open field. A large hamper, with an attendant in a brown coat standing behind it. The attendant opens the hamper and three pigeon fanciers,

in very fast motion

leap out and run off across the field, wheeling in a curve as birds do. Cut to a series of speeded-up close ups of baskets being opened and pigeon fanciers leaping out. After four or five of these fast close ups cut to long shot of the mass of pigeon fanciers wheeling accross the field like a flock of pigeons. Cut to film of Trafalgar Square. The pigeon fanciers are now running around in the square, wheeling in groups. Cut to Gilliam picture of Trafalgar Square. The chicken man from the opening credits flies past towing a banner which says 'This Space Available, tel 498 5116'. The head of a huge hedgehog - Spiny Norman - appears above St Martin's-in-the-Fields.

Spiny Norman

Dinsdale! Dinsdale!

Animated sequence then leads to:

EXTREMELY ANIMATED CAPTION: 'MONTY PYTHON PROUDLY PRESENTS THE INSURANCE SKETCH'

Interior smooth-looking office. Mr Feldman behind a desk, Mr Martin in front of it. Both point to a sign on the desk: 'Life Insurance Ltd'.

Martin

Good morning. I've been in touch with you about the, er, life insurance...

Feldman

Ah yes, did you bring the um ... the specimen of your um ... and so on, and so on?

Martin

Yes I did. It's in the car. There's rather a lot.

Feldman

Good, good.

Martin

Do you really need twelve gallons?

Feldman

No, no, not really.

Martin

Do you test it?

Feldman

No.

Martin

Well, why do you want it?

Feldman

Well, we do it to make sure that you're serious about wanting insurance, I mean, if you're not, you won't spend a couple of months filling up that enormous churn with mmm, so on and so on...

Martin

Shall I bring it in?

Feldman

Good Lord no. Throw it away.

Martin

Throw it away? I was months filling that thing up.

The sound of the National Anthem starts. They stand to attention. Martin and Feldman mutter to each other, and we hear a reverential voice over.

Voice Over

And we've just heard that Her Majesty the Queen has just tuned into this programme and so she is now watching this royal sketch here in this royal set. The actor on the left is wearing the great grey suit of the BBC wardrobe department and the other actor is ... about to deliver the first great royal joke here this royal evening.

Voice Over

Cries of disappointment. Cut to Reggie Bosanquet (the real one) at the 'News at Ten' set. He is reading.

Reggie

... despite the union's recommendation that the strikers should accept the second and third clauses of the agreement arrived at last Thursday.

Reggie

the National Anthem starts to play in the background and Reggie stands, continuing to read

A hospital: a sign above door says 'Intensive Care Unit'. A group of heavily bandaged patients with crutches, legs and arms in plaster, etc., struggle out and onto a courtyard.

First Doctor

Get on parade! Come on! We haven't got all day, have we? Come on, come on, come on.

First Doctor

the patients painfully get themselves into line

First Doctor

Hurry up ... right! Now, I know some hospitals where you get the patients lying around in bed. Sleeping, resting, recuperating, convalescing. Well, that's not the way we do things here, right! No, you won't be loafing about in bed wasting the doctors' time. You - you horrible little cripple. What's the matter with you?

Patient

Fractured tibia, sergeant.

First Doctor

'Fractured tibia, sergeant'? 'Fractured tibia, sergeant'? Ooh. Proper little mummy's boy, aren't we? Well, I'll tell you something, my fine friend, if you fracture a tibia here you keep quiet about it! Look at him!

First Doctor

looks more closely

First Doctor

He's broken both his arms and he don't go shouting about it, do he? No! 'Cos he's a man - he's a woman, you see, so don't come that broken tibia talk with me. Get on at the double. One, two, three, pick that crutch up, pick that crutch right up.

The patient hobbles off at the double and falls over.

Patient

Aaargh!

First Doctor

Right, squad, 'shun! Squad, right turn. Squad, by the left, quick limp! Come on, pick 'em up. Get some air in those wounds.

Cut to second doctor. He is smoking a cigar.

Second Doctor

Second Doctor

Here at St Pooves, we believe in ART - Active Recuperation Techniques. We try to help the patient understand that however ill he may be, he can still fulfill a useful role in society. Sun lounge please, Mr Griffiths.

Pull back to show doctor sitting in a wheelchair. A bandaged patient wheels him off.

Patient

I've got a triple fracture of the right leg, dislocated collar bone and multiple head injuries, so I do most of the heavy work, like helping the surgeon.

Interviewer's Voice

What does that involve?

Patient

Well, at the moment we're building him a holiday home.

Interviewer's Voice

What about the nurses?

Patient

Well, I don't know about them. They're not allowed to mix with the patients.

Interviewer's Voice

Do all the patients work?

Patient

No, no, the ones that are really ill do sport.

Cut to bandaged patients on a cross-country run.

Voice Over

Yes, one thing patients here dread are the runs.

The patients climb over a fence with much difficulty. One falls.

Interviewer's Voice

How are you feeling?

Patient

Much better.

Shots of patients doing sporting acivities.

Voice Over

But patients are allowed visiting. And this week they're visiting an iron foundry at Swindon, which is crying out for unskilled labour.

Voice Over

Voice Over

But this isn't the only hospital where doctors' conditions are improving.

Sign on wall: 'St Nathan's Hospital For Young, Attractive Girls Who Aren't Particularly Ill'. Pan down to a doctor.

Third Doctor

Er, very little shortage of doctors here. We have over forty doctors per bed - er, patient. Oh, be honest. Bed.

Sign: 'St Gandalf's Hospital For Very Rich People Who Like Giving Doctors Lots Of Money'. Pull back to show another doctor.

Fourth Doctor

We've every facility here for dealing with people who are rich. We can deal with a blocked purse, we can drain private accounts and in the worst cases we can perform a total cashectomy, which is total removal of all moneys from the patient.

Sign: 'St Michael's Hospital For Linkmen'. Pan down to doctor.

Fifth Doctor

Well, here we try to help people who have to link sketches together. We try to stop them saying 'Have you ever wondered what it would be like if' and instead say something like um... er... 'And now the mountaineering sketch'.

Cut to a mountaineer hanging on ropes on steep mountain face.

Mountaineer

Second Butch Voice

Who is it ... is that you, Charlie?

First Butch Voice

First Butch Voice

Cave girls... Here comes Miss Rodgers...

Light goes on to reveal a girls' dorm. In the middle of the floor between the beds are two panto geese which run off immediately the light goes on. There is one man in a string vest and short dibley haircut, chest wig, schoolgirl's skirt, white socks and schoolgirl's shoes. Hanging from the middle of the ceiling is a goat with light bulbs hanging from each foot. In the beds are other batch blokes in string vests... and short hair. At the door stands a commando-type Miss Rodgers.

Miss Rodgers

All right girls, now stop this tomfoolery and get back to bed, remember it's the big match at St Bridget's tomorrow.

Voice Over

As an admiral who came up through the ranks more times than you've had hot dinners, I wish to join my husband Admiral O.W.A Giveaway in condemning this shoddy misrepresentation of our modern navy. The British Navy is one of the finest and most attractive and butchest fighting forces in the world. I love those white flared trousers and the feel of rough blue serge on those pert little buttocks!

Cut to a man at a desk.

Presenter

I'm afraid we are unable to show you any more of that letter. We continue with a man with a stoat through his head.

Cut to a lifeboat somewhere at sea miles from any land. In the lifeboat are five bedraggled sailors, at the end of their tether.

First Sailor

Still no sign of land ... How long is it?

Second Sailor

That's a rather personal question, sir.

First Sailor

You stupid git. I meant how long we've been in the lifeboat. You've spoilt the atmosphere now.

Second Sailor

I'm sorry.

First Sailor

Shut up! We'll have to start again ... Still no sign of land ... how long is it?

Second Sailor

Thirty-three days, sir.

First Sailor

Thirty-three days?

Second Sailor

I don't think we can hold out much longer. I don't think I did spoil the atmosphere.

First Sailor

Shut up!

Second Sailor

I'm sorry, I don't think I did.

First Sailor

Of course you did.

Second Sailor

Second Sailor

Do you think I spoilt the atmosphere?

Third Sailor

Well, I think you ...

Fourth Sailor

Fourth Sailor

Wagh!

First Sailor

Still no sign of land ... how long is it?

Second Sailor

Yes. We can't go hold out much longer, sir. We haven't had any food since the fifth day.

Third Sailor

We're done for, we're done for!

First Sailor

Shut up, Maudling. We've just got to keep hoping someone will find us.

Fourth Sailor

How are you feeling, captain?

Fifth Sailor

Not too good ... I ... feel ... so weak.

Second Sailor

We can't hold out much longer.

Fifth Sailor

Listen ... chaps ... there's one last chance. I'm done for, I've got a gammy leg, I'm going fast, I'll never get through ... but ... some of you might ... so you'd better eat me.

First Sailor

Eat you, sir?

Fifth Sailor

Yes. Eat me.

Second Sailor

Uuuuggghhh! With a gammy leg?

Fifth Sailor

You don't have to eat the leg, Thompson, there's still plenty of good meat ... look at that arm.

Third Sailor

It's not just the leg, sir.

Fifth Sailor

What do you mean?

Third Sailor

Well, sir ... it's just that ...

Fifth Sailor

Why don't you want to eat me?

Third Sailor

I'd rather eat Johnson, sir.

Third Sailor

he points at fourth sailor

Second Sailor

Oh, so would I, sir.

Fifth Sailor

I see.

Fourth Sailor

Well, that's settled then. Everyone eats me.

First Sailor

Well ... I ... er ...

Third Sailor

What, sir?

First Sailor

No, no, you go ahead, I won't ...

Fourth Sailor

Nonsense, nonsense, sir, you're starving. Tuck in!

First Sailor

No, no, it's not just that ...

Second Sailor

What's the matter with Johnson, sir?

First Sailor

Well, he's not kosher.

Third Sailor

That depends how we kill him, sir.

First Sailor

Yes, yes, I see that ... well to be quite frank, I like my meat a little more lean. I'd rather eat Hodges.

Second Sailor

cheerfully

Second Sailor

Oh well ... all right.

Third Sailor

No, I'd still prefer Johnson.

Fifth Sailor

I wish you'd all stop bickering and eat me.

Second Sailor

Look! I'll tell you what. Why don't those of us who want to, eat Johnson, then you, sir, can eat my leg and then we'll make a stock of the Captain and then after that we can eat the rest of Johnson cold for supper.

First Sailor

Good thinking, Hodges.

Fourth Sailor

And we'll finnish off with the peaches.

Fourth Sailor

Voice Over

Dear Sir, I am glad to hear that your studio audience disapproves of the last skit as strongly as I. As a naval officer I abhor the implication that the Royal Navy is a haven for cannibalism. It is well known that we have the problem relatively under control, and that it is the RAF who now suffer the largest casualties in this area. And what do you think the Argylls ate in Aden. Arabs? Yours etc. Captain B.J. Smethwick in a white wine sauce with shallots, mushrooms and garlic.

Cut to man.

Stop it, stop it. Stop this cannibalism. Let's have a sketch about clean, decent human beings.

Cut to an undertaker's shop

Undertaker

Morning.

Man

Good Morning.

Undertaker

What can I do for you, squire?

Man

Um, well, I wonder if you can help me. You see, my mother has just died.

Undertaker

Ah well, we can help you. We deal with stiffs.

Man

What?

Undertaker

Well, there's three things we can do with your mum. We can bury her, burn her, or dump her.

Man

Dump her?

Undertaker

Dump her in the Thames.

Undertaker

Oh, did you like her?

Man

Yes!

Undertaker

Oh well, we won't dump her, then. Well, what do you think? We can bury her or burn her.

Man

Well, which do you recommend?

Undertaker

Well, they're both nasty. If we burn her, she gets stuffed in the flames, crackle, crackle, crackle, which is a bit of a shock if she's not quite dead, but quick.

Undertaker

the audience starts booing

Undertaker

and then we give you handful of ashes, which you can pretend are hers.

Man

Oh.

Undertaker

Or, if we bury her she gets eaten up lots of weevils, and nasty maggots,

Undertaker

the booing increases

Undertaker

which as I said before is a bit of a shock if she's not quite dead.

Man

I see. Well, she's definitely dead.

Undertaker

Where is she?

Man

She's in this sack.

Undertaker

Can I have a look? She looks quite young.

Man

Yes, yes, she was.

Increasing protests from audience

Fred

Right, I'll get the oven on.

Fred

Man

Er, excuse me, um, are you suggesting eating my mother?

Undertaker

Er ... Yeah. Not raw. Cooked.

Undertaker

Yes, roasted with a few french fries, broccoli, horseradish sauce ...

Man

Well, I do feel a bit peckish.

Voice From Audience

Disgraceful! Boo!

Voice From Audience

etc.

Undertaker

Great!

Man

Can we have some parsnips?

Undertaker

Fred - get some parsnips.

Man

I really don't think I should.

Undertaker

Look, tell you what, we'll eat her, if you feel a bit guilty about it after, we can dig a grave and you can throw up in it.

A section of the audience rises up in revolt and invades the set, remonstrating with the performers and banging the counter, etc., breaking up the sketch. Zoom away from them and into caption machine; roll credits. The National Anthem starts. The shouting stops. Mix through credits to show audience and everyone on set standing to attention. As the credits end, fade out.

The camera pans across Glencoe. The wind is whistling and climaxes with a great chord, which introduces...

Michael Norman Randall, you have been found guilty of the murder of Arthur Reginald Webster, Charles Patrick Trumpington, Marcel Agnes Bernstein, Lewis Anona Rudd, John Malcolm Kerr, Nigel Sinclair Robinson, Norman Arthur Potter, Felicity Jayne Stone, Jean-Paul Reynard, Rachel Shirley Donaldson, Stephen Jay Greenblatt, Karl-Heinz Mullet, Belinda Anne Ventham, Juan-Carlos Fernandez, Thor Olaf Stensgaard, Lord Kimberley of Pretoria, Lady Kimberley of Pretoria, The Right Honourable Nigel Warmsly Kimberley, Robert Henry Noonan and Felix James Bennett, on or about the morning of the 19th December 1972. Have you anything to say before I pass sentence?

Randall

Yes, sir. I'm very sorry.

Judge

Very sorry?

Randall

Yes, sir. It was a very very bad thing to have done and I'm really very ashamed of myself. I can only say it won't happen again. To have murdered so many people in such a short space of time is really awful, and I really am very, very, very sorry that I did it, and also that I've taken up so much of the court's valuable time listening to the sordid details of these senseless killings of mine. I would particularly like to say, a very personal and sincere 'sorry' to you, m'lud, for my appalling behaviour throughout this trial. I'd also like to say sorry to the police, for putting them to so much trouble

Randall

shot of three heavily bandaged exhausted-looking policemen behind him

Randall

for the literally hours of work they've had to put in, collecting evidence and identifying corpses and so forth. You know I think sometimes we ought to realize the difficult and often dangerous work involved in tracking down violent criminals like myself and I'd just like them to know that their fine work is at least appreciated by me.

The policemen look embarrassed.

First Policeman

No, no, we were only doing our job.

Second Policeman

No, no, no, no.

Randall

It's very good of you to say that, but I know what you've been through.

First Policeman

No, no, we've had worse.

Third Policeman

It was plain sailing apart from the arrest.

Randall

I know and I'm grateful. I'd like to apologize too to the prosecuting counsel for dragging him in here morning after morning in such lovely weather.

Counsel

Well, I would have had to come in anyway.

Randall

Ah good, but what a presentation of a case!

Counsel

Oh thank you.

Randall

No, no, it's a privilege to watch you in action. I never had a chance.

Counsel

Oh yes you did.

Randall

Not after that summing up. Great.

Counsel

very chuffed

Randall

And now I must come to the jury. What can I say. I've dragged you in here, day after day, keeping you away from your homes, your jobs, your loved ones, just to hear the private details of my petty atrocities.

Foreman

No, no, it was very interesting.

Randall

But you could have had a much nicer case.

Foreman

No, no, murder's much more fun.

First Juryman

Yes and so many of them.

Second Juryman

Excellent.

Third Juryman

We've had a terrific time.

Third Juryman

Randall

Randall

I'm sorry, I'm very moved. And so, m'lud, it only remains for you to pass the most savage sentence on me that the law can provide.

Judge

Well er... not necessarily.

Randall

No, m'lud, the full penalty of the law is hardly sufficient. I insist I must be made an example of.

Judge

Well yes and no. I mean society at large...

Randall

Oh no, m'lud. Not with mass murder.

Judge

But in this case,

Judge

Judge

don't you think?

Court

Yes, yes!

Randall

Oh, come on, m'lud, you've got to give me life.

Court

No, no, no, no.

Randall

to court at large

Randall

Well, ten years at least.

Judge

Ten years!

Court

Shame. Shame!

Randall

Well five then. Be fair.

Judge

No, no. I'm giving you three months.

Randall

Oh no, that's so embarrassing. I won't hear of it. Give me six...please.

Judge

Well, all right. Six months.

Randall

Thank you, m'lud.

After a frank exchange of views we have agreed to carry on showing this version supplied to us by the North Malden Icelandic Saga Society on the undertaking that future scenes will adhere more closely to the spirit of twelfth-century Iceland.

With moist eyes, Erik leaves this happy land to return to the harsh uneconomic realities of life in the land of Ljosa waters. On his way Erik rested a while in the land of Bjornsstrand - the land of dark forces, where Gildor was King.

Proud warriors who bore on their chests the letters of their dread name.

The knights move their shields to reveal on their breastplates the letters M.A.L.D.E.N. Shots of Erik battling with the knights. A telephone rings and the following conversation is heard.

Announcer's Voice

Hello? Is that the North Malden Icelandic Society?

Voice

Yes, that's right.

Announcer

About this saga.

Voice

Oh yes, the Icelandic saga.

Announcer

Yes.

Voice

Good, isn't it.

Announcer

Well er, I don't know, but you promised us that you would stick to the spirit of the original text.

Announcer

Well I mean a lot of these things that are happening, well they just don't quite ring true.

One of the knights is carrying a sign: 'Malden, Gateway to Industry'.

Voice

Well, it's a new interpretation really.

Another carries a sign, 'ICI thanks Malden'.

Announcer

Well we don't want a new...

FLASH FRAME CAPTION: 'INVEST IN MALDEN'

Announcer

... I mean we wanted the proper thing... I mean just look what's happening now.

More signs: 'Invest in Malden', 'Malden - 45% Interest Free Loans '.

Voice

Banners were a very important part of Icelandic lore, Mr Mills.

Announcer

No, no, I'm sorry I, I can't accept that, it's gone too far, I'm very sorry but we'll have to terminate the agreement. You're just trying to cash in on the BBC's exciting Icelandic saga.

The knights are carrying more and more advertising banners and signs.

Voice

That's business, Mr Mills.

Announcer

Well, that's as maybe but it's not the way the BBC works.

Voice

Well I'm sorry you feel that way but er, you know, if you ever want to come to Malden...

Usual dramatic music. Fade music as we come up on a courtroom. A man, Mr Birchenhall, is giving evidence.

Man

8 o'clock is a peak viewing hour so naturally we tend to stick to our comedy output - unless of course there's sport - because of course we know this is popular, and popularity is what television is about. Quite frankly I'm sick and tired of people accusing us of being ratings conscious.

Judge

Judge

Ratings conscious?

Clerk

Transmitting bland garbage, m'lud.

Thank you.

No really - I'm absolutely fed up with this. I really am.

Erik comes into the dock. He is bandaged almost totally, like a cocoon, including his head. He wears a Viking fur hat, The usher approaches him with the card and Bible.

Usher

You are Erik Njorl, son of Frothgar...

Judge

Get on with it!

Usher

Will you raise your right hand.

Judge

He obviously can't raise his right hand, you silly usher person... can you raise your right leg Mr Njorl?

Njorl shakes his head.

Usher

Can you raise any part of your body, Mr Njorl?

Njorl leans over and whispers in the usher's ear.

Usher

I see... well, we'll skip that... well, just take the book in your right hand Mr Njorl without raising any part of your body... Oh ....

Judge

What is it now, you persistently silly usher?

Usher

He can't hold the Bible m'lud.

Judge

Well screw the Bible! Let's get on with this bleeding trial, I've got a Gay Lib meeting at 6 o'clock. Superintendent Lufthansa will you please read the charge.

Superintendent

Is a charge strictly necessary, m'lud?

Judge

heavy aside

Judge

The press is here.

Superintendent

Oh sorry! Right, here we go. You are hereby charged. One, that you did, on or about 1126, conspire to publicize a London Borough in the course of a BBC saga; two, that you were wilfully and persistently a foreigner; three, that you conspired to do things not normally considered illegal; four, that you were caught in possession of an offensive weapon, viz, the big brown table down at the police station.

Judge

The big brown table down at the police station?

Superintendent

It's the best we could find, m'lud ... and five... all together now...

The whole court shout together.

Court

Assaulting a police officer!

Prosecuting Counsel

Call Police Constable Pan-Am.

Prosecuting Counsel

Pan-Am runs into court and starts beating Njorl with a truncheon

Prosecuting Counsel

the policeman gets into box hitting at anyone within range; his colleagues restrain him

Prosecuting Counsel

Now, you are Police Constable Pan-Am?

Constable

No, I shall deny that to the last breath in my body.

Constable

Oh. Sorry, yes.

Prosecuting Counsel

Police constable, do you recognize the defendant?

Constable

No. Never seen him before in my life.

Prosecuting Counsel

Constable, will you please tell the court in your own words what happened?

Constable

Oh yes!

the superintendent shakes his head

Constable

No, anyway I clearly saw the deceased...

Clerk

Defendant.

Constable

Defendant! Sorry. Sorry, super. I clearly saw the defendant ... doing whatever he's accused of...Red-handed. When kicked... he said: 'It's a fair ... cop, I done it all ... Right... no doubt about... that'. Then, bound as he was to the chair, he assaulted myself and three other constables while bouncing around the cell. The end.

Spontaneous applause from the court. Shouts of 'more! more!'. Pan-am raises his hands and the clapping and shouting dies down.

Constable

Thank you, thank you... and for my next piece of evidence...

Superintendent

I think you'd better leave it there, constable.

Prosecuting Counsel

Excellent evidence, constable

Prosecuting Counsel

the constable is removed, flailing his truncheon the while

Trading was crisp at the start of the day with some brisk business on the floor. Rubber hardened and string remained confident. Little bits of tin consolidated although biscuits sank after an early gain and stools remained anonymous. Armpits rallied well after a poor start. Nipples rose dramatically during the morning but had declined by mid-afternoon, while teeth clenched and buttocks remained firm. Small dark furry things increased severely on the floor, whilst rude jellies wobbled up and down, and bounced against rising thighs which had spread to all parts of the country by mid-afternoon. After lunch naughty things dipped sharply forcing giblets upwards with the nicky nacky noo. Ting tang tong rankled dithely, little tipples pooped and poppy things went pong!

Busy day?

Mrs Premise

Busy! I've just spent four hours burying the cat.

Mrs Conclusion

Four hours to bury a cat?

Mrs Premise

Yes! It wouldn't keep still, wriggling about howling its head off.

Mrs Conclusion

Oh - it wasn't dead then?

Mrs Premise

Well, no, no, but it's not at all a well cat so as we were going away for a fortnight's holiday, I thought I'd better bury it just to be on the safe side.

Mrs Conclusion

Quite right. You don't want to come back from Sorento to a dead cat. It'd be so anticlimactic. Yes, kill it now, that's what I say.

Mrs Premise

Yes.

Mrs Conclusion

We're going to have our budgie put down.

Mrs Premise

Really? Is it very old?

Mrs Conclusion

No. We just don't like it. We're going to take it to the vet tomorrow.

Mrs Premise

Tell me, how do they put budgies down then?

Mrs Conclusion

Well it's funny you should ask that, but I've just been reading a great big book about how to put your budgie down, and apparently you can either hit them with the book, or, you can shoot them just there, just above the beak.

Mrs Premise

Just there!

Mrs Conclusion

Yes.

Mrs Premise

Well well well. 'Course, Mrs Essence flushed hers down the loo.

Mrs Conclusion

Ooh! No! You shouldn't do that - no that's dangerous. Yes, they breed in the sewers, and eventually you get evil-smelling flocks of huge soiled budgies flying out of people's lavatories infringing their personal freedom.

Mrs Conclusion

life-size cut-out of woman at end of last animation goes by

Mrs Conclusion

Good morning Mrs Cut-out.

Mrs Premise

It's a funny thing freedom. I mean how can any of us be really free when we still have personal possessions.

Mrs Conclusion

You can't. You can't. I mean, how can I go off and join Frelimo when I've got nine more installments to pay on the fridge.

Mrs Premise

No, you can't. You can't. Well this is the whole crux of Jean-Paul Sartre's 'Roads to Freedom'.

Mrs Conclusion

No, it bloody isn't. The nub of that is, his characters stand for all of us in their desire to avoid action. Mind you, the man at the off-licence says it's an everyday story of French country folk.

Mrs Premise

What does he know?

Mrs Conclusion

Nothing.

Mrs Premise

Sixty new pence for a bottle of Maltese Claret. Well I personally think Jean-Paul's masterwork is an allegory of man's search for commitment.

Mrs Conclusion

No it isn't.

Mrs Premise

Yes it is.

Mrs Conclusion

Isn't.

Mrs Premise

'Tis.

Mrs Premise

All right. We can soon settle this. We'll ask him.

Mrs Conclusion

Do you know him?

Mrs Premise

Yes, we met on holiday last year.

Mrs Conclusion

In Ibeezer?

Mrs Premise

Yes. He was staying there with his wife and Mr and Mr Genet. Oh, I did get on well with Madam S. We were like that.

Mrs Conclusion

What was Jean-Paul like?

Mrs Premise

Well, you know, a bit moody. Yes, he didn't join in the fun much. Just sat there thinking. Still, Mr Rotter caught him a few times with the whoopee cushion.

Mrs Premise

Nice to meet you, dear.

Hello.

How's the old man, then?

Mrs Sartre

Oh, don't ask. He's in one of his bleeding moods. 'The bourgeoisie this is the bourgeoisie that' - he's like a little child sometimes. I was only telling the Rainiers the other day - course he's always rude to them, only classy friends we've got - I was saying solidarity with the masses I said... pie in the sky! Oooh! You're not a Marxist are you Mrs Conclusion?

Mrs Conclusion

No, I'm a Revisionist.

Mrs Sartre

Oh good. I mean, look at this place! I'm at my wits end. Revolutionary leaflets everywhere. One of these days I'll revolutionary leaflets him. If it wasn't for the goat you couldn't get in here for propaganda.

Shot of a goat eating leaflets in corner of room.

Mrs Premise

Oh very well. Can we pop in and have a word with him?

Mrs Sartre

Yes come along.

Mrs Premise

Thank you.

Mrs Sartre

But be careful. He's had a few. Mind you he's as good as gold in the morning, I've got to hand it to him, but come lunchtime it's a bottle of vin ordinaire - six glasses and he's ready to agitate.

Mrs Premise and Mrs Conclusion knock on the door of Jean-Paul's room.

Coo-ee! Jean-Paul? Jean-Paul! It's only us. Oh pardon ... c'est même nous...

They enter. We do not see Jean-Paul although we hear his voice.

Pull back from a shot of an old little Ford Popular to reveal Mr and Mrs Norris, standing with it outside the front garden of a small suburban semi-detached house.

Voice Over

Who, a year ago, had heard of Mr and Mrs Brian Norris of 37, Gledhill Gardens, Parsons Green? And yet their epic journey in EBW 343 has set them alongside Thor Heyerdahl and Sir Edmund Hillary. Starting only with a theory, Mr Norris set out to prove that the inhabitants of Hounslow could have been descendants of the people of Surbiton who had made the great trek north. No newcomer to this field, Mr Norris's 'A Short History of Motor Traffic Between Purley and Esher' had become a best-selling minor classic in the car-swapping belt.

Apparently small investors were attracted by the wide-ranging portfolio and that in the first week the limited offer was oversubscribed eight times.

Shut up, Stebbins! I haven't finished. Oh, by the way, congratulations on winning the Italian Grand Prix at Monza.

Stebbins

Thank you, sir.

Headmaster

Shut up. Now then, this sort of extra-curricular capitalist expansion has got to stop. I made it quite clear when Potter tried to go public last term, that these massive stock exchange deals must not happen in Big School. Is that clear, Balderston?

Yes, sir.

Hello, Alan.

Alan

Hello, Jackie.

Jackie

Well, first of all become a doctor and discover a marvellous cure for something, and then, when the medical profession really starts to take notice of you, you can jolly well tell them what to do and make sure they get everything right so there'll never be any diseases ever again.

Alan

Thanks, Jackie. Great idea. How to play the flute.

Alan

picking up a flute

Alan

Well here we are. You blow there and you move your fingers up and down here.

Noel

Great, great, Alan. Well, next week we'll be showing you how black and white people can live together in peace and harmony, and Alan will be over in Moscow showing us how to reconcile the Russians and the Chinese. So, until next week, cheerio.

Alan

Bye.

Jackie

Children's music. Pull out to reveal that the 'Blue Peter' set is in one corner of a stockbroker-belt sitting room. Two ladies are sitting by the fire looking at a photo album.

Mrs Nigger-Baiter

Oh, yes, he's such a clever little boy, just like his father.

Mrs S

D'you think so, Mrs Nigger-Baiter?

Mrs Nigger-Baiter

Oh yes, spitting image.

The door opens. The son comes in.

Son

Good afternoon, mother. Good afternoon, Mrs Nigger-Baiter.

Mrs Nigger-Baiter

Ooh, he's walking already!

Mrs S

Yes, he's such a clever little boy, aren't you? Coochy coochy coo . . .

Mrs Nigger-Baiter

Hello, coochy coo...

Mrs S

Hello, hello...

Mrs S

Mrs Nigger-Baiter

Oochy coochy.

Mrs Nigger-Baiter

the son smiles a little tight smile

Mrs Nigger-Baiter

Look at him laughing... ooh, he's a chirpy little fellow. Isn't he a chirpy little fellow ... eh? eh? Does he talk Does he talk, eh?

Son

Of course I talk, I'm Minister for Overseas Development.

Mrs Nigger-Baiter

Ooh, he's a clever little boy - he's a clever little boy.

Mrs Nigger-Baiter

Mrs Nigger-Baiter

Do you like your rattle? Do you like your rattle? Look at his little eyes following it ... look at his iggy piggy piggy little eyeballs eh... oo... he's got a tubby tum-tum. Oh, he's got a tubby tum-tum.

Son

whilst Mrs Nigger-Baiter is talking

Son

Mother, could I have a quick cup of tea please. I have an important statement on Rhodesia to make in the Commons at six.

Sound of an explosion out of vision. Cut to reveal Mrs Nigger-Baiter's chair charred and smoking. Mrs Nigger-Baiter is no longer there. The upholstery is smouldering gently.

Mrs S

Oh, Mrs Nigger-Baiter's exploded.

Son

Good thing, too.

Mrs S

She was my best friend.

Son

Oh, mother, don't be so sentimental. Things explode every day.

Mrs S

Yes, I suppose so. Anyway, I didn't really like her that much.

The doorbell rings. Mrs S goes to the door. A vicar with a suitcase.

Vicar

Hello, I'm your new vicar. Can I interest you in any encyclopaedias?

Mrs S

Ah, no thank you. We're not Church people, thank you.

The vicar opens his suitcase to reveal it is packed with brushes.

Vicar

How about brushes? Nylon or bristle? Strong-tufted, attractive colours.

Mrs S

No - really, thank you, vicar.

Vicar

Oh dear ... Turkey? Cup final tickets?

Mrs S

No, no really, we're just not religious thank you.

Vicar

Oh, well. Bye bye.

Mrs S

Bye bye, vicar.

Mrs S

she shuts the door, as she returns to seat the vicar pops his head round the door again

Vicar

Remember, if you do want anything... jewellery, Ascot water heaters...

Mrs S

Thank you, vicar.

Mrs S

Mrs S

It's funny, isn't it? How your best friend can just blow up like that? I mean, you wouldn't think it was medically possible, would you?

Cut to a doctor in a posh consulting room.

Doctor

This is where Mrs Shazam was so wrong. Exploding is a perfectly normal medical phenomenon. In many fields of medicine nowadays, a dose of dynamite can do a world of good. For instance, athlete's foot - an irritating condition - can be cured by applying a small charge of TNT between each toe.

Doctor

Doctor

he opens the door

Vicar

Hello, I'm your new vicar, can I interest you in any of these watches, pens or biros?

Vicar

Doctor

No ... I'm not religious, I'm afraid.

Vicar

Oh, souvenirs, badges... a little noddy dog for the back of the car?

Doctor

No thank you, vicar. Good morning.

Vicar

Oh, morning.

He shuts the door.

Doctor

Now, many of the medical profession are sceptical about my work. They point to my record of treatment of athlete's foot sufferers - eighty-four dead, sixty-five severely wounded and twelve missing believed cured. But then, people laughed at Bob Hope, people laughed at my wife when she wrapped herself up in greaseproof paper and hopped into the Social Security office, but that doesn't mean that Pasteur was wrong! Look, I'll show you what I mean.

Doctor

Maurice

She was such a good composer that everybody, but everybody, wanted to know, and quite right too, because she wrote some lovely bits, such as Sally Sleeping Beauty, Patsy Pathétique, Adrian 1812 and lots of Conny concerti for Vera violin and Peter Piano Fanny Forte.

Cut back to second presenter.

Second Presenter

But what do we really know of this tortured ponce?

Cut to space-programme-type set. Experts at a desk. An Apollo-type monograph behind them says 'Tchaikowsky XII'. The centre motif is a picture of Tschaikowsky.

Expert

Well, if you can imagine the size of Nelson's Column, which is roughly three times the size of a London bus, then Tschaikowsky was much smaller. His head was about the same size as that of an extremely large dog, that is to say, two very small dogs, or four very large hamsters, or one medium-size rabbit if you count the whole of the body and not just the head. Robin.

He has a model of Tschaikowsky which comes apart.

Voice Over

Here to play Tchaikowsky's first piano concerto in B Flat Minor is the world-famous soloist Sviatoslav Richter. During the performance he will escape from a sack, three padlocks and a pair of handcuffs.

A chained figure in a sack rolls into shot and starts rolling about and playing the piano concerto. After a minute 'Rita' enters and gestures to him. She is in fish-net tights, etc, - the full conjurer's assistant. He wriggles free from the sack, playing the while. The music stops.

Cut to scrubland, barbed wire a la prison camp in the background. After a few seconds a head appears out of a hole in the ground. He looks around then gets out. He is wearing trim-jeans. He looks back. Satisfied he beckons. Others start appearing. Three German guards behind the wire muttering.

SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'INCHES LOST SO FAR'

A superimposed counter shows the numbers increasing.

Guard

Achtung! Halt! Halt!

A moment's panic. Shooting starts and a siren goes. Men pour out of hole rapidly. Guards pursue them with tracker dogs in trim-jeans. The counter goes berserk.

An animated item ends with a sign saying 'And now, the Fish Slapping Dance.'

Cut to a quayside. John and Michael, dressed in tropical gear and solar topees. John stannds still while Michael dances up and down before him to the jolly music of Edward German. Michael holds up two tiny fish and from time to time in the course of the dance he slaps John lightly across the cheeks with them. The music ends; Michael stops dancing. John produces a great fish and swipes Michael with it. Michael falls off the quay into the water.

ANIMATION:

Nazi Fish

The Nazi fish is swallowed by a fish with an RAF emblem.

British Fish

This is your captain speaking. There is no need for panic. Woman and children first. I repeat that, women and children first.

Cut to the ship's bridge. The captain and two or three officers are seen scrambling into ladies clothing or young children's short trousers and school satchels and caps. The ship pitches and rolls in the gale. The captain is still trying to speak into the PA.

Captain

Do not rush for the lifeboats - remember, women and children first.

A first officer is revealed in the corner of the bridge putting a head-dress on a Red Indian outfit.

Third Officer

Well it's a sort of impression of what a kind of Renaissance courtier artist might have looked like at the court of one of the great families like the Medicis or the Borgias...

Fourth Officer

No it's not, it's more Flemish than Italian.

Fifth Officer

Yes - that's a Flemish merchant of the fifteenth or sixteenth centuries...

Third Officer

What! With these tassles?

Fourth Officer

Yes, yes. They had those fined doublets going tapering down into the full hose you know - exactly like that.

Captain

puts his hand over the PA

Captain

Now, what is it meant to be? I've got to tell them something. .. is it a Flemish merchant?

Third Officer

No, it is not a Flemish merchant. It's more a sort of idealized version of the complete Renaissance Man...

Oh, all right.

Third Officer's Voice

Flemish merchants did not wear hand-embroidered chevrons. They did not!

The door opens and two guards roughly push in the captain in drag, another officer half in drag, half in naval uniform, two officers hastily dressed as children, a complete Renaissance Man, a Red Indian and a spaceman. They stand there for a moment. Then one of the guards pushes his way forward and hands the police chief a piece of paper.

Cut to a newsreader in a 'News at Nine' set with a bare light bulb hanging in shot. He wears only an old blanket around his shoulders. He is shivering.

The door is flung open and the second - trouserless - guard rushes in.

Second Guard

Captain

We are from SS Mother Goose. We were twelve days out from Port of Spain, and one night I was doing my usual rounds, when I had occasion to pass the forward storage lockers...

Slightly eerie music has crept in under his words and the screen goes into a ripple. It gets right out of focus and continues to ripple as it pulls back into focus. Ripple stops and they are still in the same set as they were.

Police Chief

Go on!

Captain

Well, I noticed something unusual, the main bilge hatches had been opened...

Captain

at this point three men in brown coats come in and start taking pictures off the wall, clearing props and chairs from the set, etc.

Captain

the flats start to be flown up, revealing behind a sitting room - so that we can see the police office has been built in the Kelly's sitting room

Captain

As soon as it saw me, its horrible face split aside in a ghastly look of terror. His head, which was like ...

By this time the whole office set has been removed revealing the Kelly's boarding house sitting room. Mr and Mrs Kelly come in through door and put their heads round.

Mrs Kelly

What's this about doing the 'Horse of the Year Show' in here tonight?

Police Chief

I'm sorry, Mrs Kelly. We don't know, I'm afraid - this is drama.

Mrs Kelly

Mr Fox told me, before he went down to the pub, that they were doing 'Horse of the Year Show' in here tonight at 9.10.

Mr Kelly goes.

Captain

I fought it with all my strength, but it was too much for me...

Cut to Mr and Mrs Kelly coming through the hall. We can hear the captain's voice growing faster. Mr and Mrs Kelly go towards the kitchen door and stop and listen. We have lost the captain's voice by now, but from inside the kitchen we hear 'Horse of the Year Show' sound track.

Well, that's all from BBC Television for this evening...

Mrs Kelly

slamming door on him

Mrs Kelly

Shove off! Go and find yourself another flat! Get out!

As she slams the door, a piece of paper (obviously a tax return form) is shoved through the door. It has the credits scribbled hurriedly on it; the camera pans into it. After the credits Mrs Kelly stamps on the paper.

Good evening and welcome to 'The Money Programme'. Tonight on 'The Money Programme', we're going to look at money. Lots of it. On film, and in the studio.

Voice Over

Meanwhile in the jungle next door.

A steamy tropical jungle. A native guide leads four explorers in pith helmets and old-fashioned long shorts through the jungle. Cicada sounds and shrieks of predatory jungle birds. Intercut close ups of perspiring foreheads etc. The native guide keeps beckoning them to hurry. The jungle appears to get thicker: they have to push their way through the undergrowth. Finally the guide stops and points, with eyes staring. The four explorers cluster around and look over his shoulder. A neat clearing in the thick of the jungle. Tables set as in a London bistro with check cloths and big wooden pepper mills, candles and menus standing on each table. Sitting at the tables are six other explorers in pith helmets etc., eating and chatting. Clink of coffee cups.

First Explorer

What a simply super little place!

Second Explorer

Yes, they've done wonders with it. You know this used to be one of the most swampy disease infested areas of the whole jungle, and they've turned it into this smashing little restaurant.

Second Explorer

across the restaurant the head waiter appears, dressed in black tie and tails just a bit too big for him; he beckons them to a table

Second Explorer

Here you are Omkami, thank you. Hello, Mr Akwekwe.

Akwekwe

Hello, Mr Spare-Buttons-Supplied-With-The-Shirt. Nice to see you again.

Second Explorer

These are some of my fellow explorers: Sir Charles Farquarson, Brian Bailey, Betty Bailey and this is Mr Akwekwe, who started the whole place.

Third Explorer

It really is super.

Fourth Explorer

who is dressed as a man and has a moustache

Fourth Explorer

Terrific idea.

Akwekwe

May I recommend the alligator purees.

Suddenly there is a hideous scream. We see a gorilla tear a man from his table at the back of the restaurant, in front of a tree and drag him back into the jungle. Awful shrieks are heard. Akwekwe runs into the jungle shouting, Terrible sounds of the unseen fight. Thrashing about of bushes in the distance. A shot rings out. Then silence also rings out. Akwekwe emerges, dragging the inert body of the customer whom he puts back in his chair. He slumps forward. Akwekwe comes back to the table in the foreground which has remained in the foreground throughout this preceding shot, with cut ins of the four explorers looking through the menu. Akwekwe has a bloodstained claw mark right across his face and chest and his dicky is torn and bloodstained.

Akwekwe

Now then, have you decided?

He produces a notepad such as waiters always carry.

Second Explorer

Ye-es ... Well there's two avocado vinaigrette here and what are you going to have Brian?

Fourth Explorer

Er quiche lorraine for me, please.

Akwekwe

Right, so that's two avocado, one quiche ...

Cut to close up of pygmy's evil face parting leaves and firing a blow-pipe. Cut to another table where two explorers are having coffee and cigars. One of them stiffens and then slumps firward. Cut to Akwekwe at the main table registering what has happened. We pan with him as he rushes over to the bushes. Sound of pygmies retreating into the bushes. Akwekwe shouts after him. We pan with Akwekwe as he walks over to the table where the customer has slumped forward. He pulls him up, looks at dart sticking out of his chest, tut tuts with annoyance and lets him slump back on to the table again. He returns to the main table.

Akwekwe

So, that's two avocado, one quiche ...

Third Explorer

And a soup of the day.

Akwekwe

Right.

Akwekwe

sinister sound of jungle drums in distance; close up of look of fear in Akwekwe's eyes

Akwekwe

And to follow?

Second Explorer

Two chicken à la reine, with sauce provençale.

First Explorer

And one scampi desirée.

Third Explorer

And boeuf bourguignon with a green salad.

Jungle drums getting louder. Akwekwe shouts off towards the back of the clearing where we assume the kitchens mast be.

Akwekwe

Right on. Two chicken! One scampi! One boeuf with green salad!

He casts yet another fearful glance in the direction of the ever-increasing drum beats.

Akwekwe

There may be ... a little delay.

Second Explorer

That's fine but we have to be out by three.

Akwekwe

Yes, sir. Yes, we'll try.

The drum beats get louder. Shot of forest, rustling of bushes. Close up of Akwekwe's eyes. Another shot of forest. Drum beats louder. More rustling. Close up of Akwekwe's eyes and sweating forehead. Forest again and more noise. Close up of Akwekwe; he now has blood on his face, his eyes dilate with fear, the drum beats become deafening. Sudden cut to BBC world symbol.

The BBC would like to announce that the next scene is not considered suitable for family viewing. It contains scenes of violence, involving people's heads and arms getting chopped off, their ears nailed to trees, and their toenails pulled out in slow motion. There are also scenes of naked women with floppy breasts, and also at one point you can see a pair of buttocks and there's another bit where I'll swear you can see everything, but my friend says it's just the way he's holding the spear.

Because of the unsuitability of the scene, the BBC will be replacing it with a scene from a repeat of 'Gardening Club' for 1958.

A beautiful well-stocked garden bed. 'Gardening Club' music. After two seconds there are shrieks of licentious and lustful laughter. A nude woman pursues a city gent, both screaming with pleasure, into the middle of the flowerbed and they roll around smashing up the flowers in unbridled erotic orgy. Immediately two nuns run in to join the fun, followed by two Vikings, a gumby, a pantomime goose, etc. The whole of this orgy is speeded up.

And now back to the story.

Cut to the edge of the jungle. Emerging from the dense undergrowth are two pygmy warriors pulling the four explorers who are roped together. The pygmies carry spears. We lose the pygmies and hold just the explorers in frame, and track with them.

Third Explorer

That was a nasty business back at the restaurant.

First Explorer

Yes, I thought most places took Barclaycard nowadays.

Second Explorer

Where do you think they're taking us, Brian?

Fourth Explorer

God knows!

Cut to a stock shot of a volcano. Thrilling chord. Cut back to explorers.

Cut to stock shot of collection of big chimneys in a brickworks. Another thrilling chord. Cut back to explorers.

First Explorer

The London Brick Company?

Third Explorer

No, no, no, no - next to that.

Cut to stock shot of plateau of Roiurama. Yet another thrilling chord. Cut back to explorers.

First Explorer

The forbidden plateau of Roiurama, the Lost World, thrown up by mighty earth movements thousands of millions of years ago, where strange primeval creatures defying evolution, lurk in the dark, impenetrable forests, cut off forever from the outside world.

Second Explorer

I still can't see it.

Fourth Explorer

You don't think that's where they're taking us?

Third Explorer

Yes, and God knows what we'll find there.

A pigmy native rushes up from behind them, holding a script.

Native

Second Explorer

What?

Native

Native

What page in the script?

Second Explorer

Meanwhile back in London ... at the British Explorers' Club in the Mall...

Cut to the leather-armchaired hallway of a London club. In four of the chairs sit men in polar explorers' kit - furs, iced-over goggles, etc. - reading newspapers. At one chair sits a man in Norfolk jacket and plus fours. Around his neck he wears a sign saying 'Our Hero'. He is reading a newspaper but obviously has something else on his mind. Suddenly he throws the paper down and gets up. He walks over to the porter's desk. As he does this a polar expedition with four huskies, a sled, and two explorers pass him. Our Hero goes up to the desk. A whiskery old porter stands behind it.

Our Hero

Wait a moment!

Fourth Explorer

What is it?

First Explorer

If we're on film, there must be someone filming us.

Second Explorer

My God, Betty, you're right!

They all look around, then gradually all notice the camera. They break out in smiles of relief, come towards the camera and greet the camera crew.

Third Explorer

Look! Great to see you!

First Explorer

What a stroke of luck!

Camera Crew

Hello! ...

First Explorer

Wait a minute!

Fourth Explorer

What is it again?

First Explorer

If this is the crew who were filming us . .. who's filming us now? Look!

Receptionist

Yes, sir?

Man

I'd like to have an argument please.

Receptionist

Certainly, sir. Have you been here before...?

Man

No, this is my first time.

Receptionist

I see. Do you want to have the full argument, or were you thinking of taking a course?

Man

Well, what would be the cost?

Receptionist

Yes, it's one pound for a five-minute argument, but only eight pounds for a course of ten.

Man

Well, I think it's probably best if I start with the one and see how it goes from there. OK?

Receptionist

Fine. I'll see who's free at the moment ... Mr. Du-Bakey's free, but he's a little bit conciliatory ... yes, try Mr. Barnard - Room 12.

Man

Thank you.

The man walks down a corridor. He opens door 12. There is a man at a desk.

Mr Barnard

What do you want?

Man

Well I was told outside ...

Mr Barnard

Don't give me that you snotty-faced heap of parrot droppings!

What!

Shut your festering gob you tit! Your type makes me puke! You vacuous toffee-nosed malodorous pervert!

Look! I came here for an argument.

Oh! I'm sorry, this is abuse.

Oh I see, that explains it.

No, you want room 12A next door.

I see - sorry.

Stupid git.

Outside 12A. The man knocks on the door.

Mr Vibrating

Mr Vibrating

Come in.

The man enters the room. Mr Vibrating is sitting at a desk.

Man

Is this the right room for an argument?

Mr Vibrating

I've told you once.

Man

No you haven't.

Mr Vibrating

Yes I have.

Man

When?

Mr Vibrating

Just now!

Man

No you didn't.

Mr Vibrating

Yes I did!

Man

Didn't.

Mr Vibrating

Did.

Mr Vibrating

I'm telling you I did!

Man

You did not!

Mr Vibrating

I'm sorry, is this a five minute argument, or the full half hour?

Man

Oh ... Just a five-minute one.

Mr Vibrating

Fine

Mr Vibrating

makes a note of it; the man sists down

Mr Vibrating

thank you. Anyway, I did.

Man

You most certainly did not.

Mr Vibrating

Now, let's get one thing quite clear. I most definitely told you!

Man

You did not.

Mr Vibrating

Yes I did.

Mr Vibrating

Yes I did!!

Man

Look, this isn't an argument.

Mr Vibrating

Yes it is.

Man

No it isn't, it's just contradiction.

Mr Vibrating

No it isn't.

Man

Yes it is.

Mr Vibrating

It is not.

Man

It is. You just contradicted me.

Mr Vibrating

No I didn't.

Man

Ooh, you did!

Mr Vibrating

No, no, no, no, no.

Man

You did, just then.

Mr Vibrating

No, nonsense!

Man

Oh, look this is futile.

Man

I came here for a good argument.

Mr Vibrating

No you didn't, you came here for an argument.

Man

Well, an argument's not the same as contradiction.

Mr Vibrating

It can be.

Man

No it can't. An argument is a connected series of statements to establish a definite proposition.

Man

Yes it is. It isn't just contradiction.

Mr Vibrating

Look, if I argue with you, I must take up a contrary position.

Man

But it isn't just saying 'No it isn't'.

Man

No it isn't, Argument is an intellectual process ... contradiction is just the automatic gainsaying of anything the other person says.

Mr Vibrating

Not at all.

Man

Now look!

Mr Vibrating

pressing the bell on his desk

Mr Vibrating

That's it. Good morning.

Man

But I was just getting interested.

Mr Vibrating

Sorry the five minutes is up.

Man

That was never five minutes just now!

Mr Vibrating

I'm afraid it was.

Man

No it wasn't.

Mr Vibrating

I'm sorry, I'm not allowed to argue any more.

Man

What!?

Mr Vibrating

If you want me to go on arguing you'll have to pay for another five minutes.

Man

But that was never five minutes just now ... oh Come on!

Man

Vibrating looks round as though man was not there

Man

This is ridiculous.

Mr Vibrating

I'm very sorry, but I told you I'm not allowed to argue unless you've paid.

Man

Oh. all right.

Man

pays

Man

There you are.

Mr Vibrating

Thank you.

Man

Well?.

Mr Vibrating

Well what?

Man

That was never five minutes just now.

Mr Vibrating

I told you I'm not allowed to argue unless you've paid!

Man

I've just paid.

Mr Vibrating

No you didn't.

Man

I did! I did! I did!

Man

Look I don't want to argue about that.

Mr Vibrating

Well I'm very sorry but you didn't pay.

Man

Aha! Well if I didn't pay, why are you arguing ... got you!

Mr Vibrating

No you haven't.

Man

Yes I have ... if you're arguing I must have paid.

Mr Vibrating

Not necessarily. I could be arguing in my spare time.

Man

I've had enough of this.

Man

Oh shut up!

Man

he leaves and sees a door marked complaints; he goes in

Man

I want to complain.

Man in charge

You want to complain ... look at these shoes ... I've only had them three weeks and the heels are worn right through.

Man

Waaghh!

Spreaders

Better. Better. But 'waaaaaghh'! 'Waaaagh'! Hold your hands here ...

That's it. That's it. Good.

Man

Stop hitting me!

Spreaders

What?

Man

Stop hitting me.

Spreaders

Stop hitting you?

Man

Yes.

Spreaders

What did you come in here for then?

Man

I came here to complain.

Spreaders

Oh I'm sorry, that's next door. It's being hit on the head lessons in here.

Man

Detective Inspector Fox enters

Fox

Spreaders

WAAGH!

Man

Inspector

Good. Now I'm arrestin' this entire show on three counts: one, acts of self-conscious behaviour contrary to the 'Not in front of the children' Act, two, always saying 'It's so and so of the Yard' every time the fuzz arrives and, three, and this is the cruncher, offenses against the 'Getting out of sketches without using a proper punchline' Act, four, namely, simply ending every bleedin' sketch by just having a policeman come in and... wait a minute.

Another policeman enters.

Yes, of course we will want as security the deeds of your house, of your aunt's house, of your second cousin's house, of your wife's parents' house, and of your grannie's bungalow, and we will in addition need a controlling interest in your new company, unrestricted access to your private bank account, the deposit in our vaults of your three children as hostages and a full legal indemnity against any acts of embezzlement carried out against you by any members of our staff during the normal course of their duties... no, I'm afraid we couldn't accept your dog instead of your youngest child, we would like to suggest a brand new scheme of ours under which 51% of both your dog and your wife pass to us in the event of your suffering a serious accident. Fine. No, not at all, nice to do business with you.

City Gent

City Gent

a knock on the door

City Gent

Mr Ford enters, he is collecting for charity with a tin

City Gent

Ah, Mr Ford isn't it?

Mr Ford

That's right.

City Gent

How do you do. I'm a merchant banker.

Mr Ford

How do you do Mr...

City Gent

Er... I forget my name for the moment but I am a merchant banker.

Mr Ford

Oh. I wondered whether you'd like to contribute to the orphan's home.

Mr Ford

he rattles the tin

City Gent

Well I don't want to show my hand too early, but actually here at Slater Nazi we are quite keen to get into orphans, you know, developing market and all that... what sort of sum did you have in mind?

Mr Ford

Well... er... you're a rich man.

City Gent

Yes, I am. Yes. Yes, very very rich. Quite phenomenally wealthy. Yes, I do own the most startling quantifies of cash. Yes, quite right... you're rather a smart young lad aren't you. We could do with somebody like you to feed the pantomime horse. Very smart.

Mr Ford

Thank you, sir.

City Gent

Now, you were saying. I'm very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very rich.

Mr Ford

So er, how about a pound?

City Gent

A pound. Yes, I see. Now this loan would be secured by the...

Mr Ford

It's not a loan, sir.

City Gent

What?

Mr Ford

It's not a loan.

City Gent

Ah.

Mr Ford

You get one of these, sir.

Mr Ford

he gives him a flag

City Gent

It's a bit small for a share certificate isn't it? Look, I think I'd better run this over to our legal department. If you could possibly pop back on Friday...

Mr Ford

Well do you have to do that, couldn't you just give me the pound?

City Gent

Yes, but you see I don't know what it's for.

Mr Ford

It's for the orphans.

City Gent

Yes?

Mr Ford

It's a gift.

City Gent

A what?

Mr Ford

A gift.

City Gent

Oh a gift!

Mr Ford

Yes.

City Gent

A tax dodge.

Mr Ford

No, no, no, no.

City Gent

No? Well, I'm awfully sorry I don't understand. Can you just explain exactly what you want.

Mr Ford

Well, I want you to give me a pound, and then I go away and give it to the orphans.

Mr Ford

Well, that's it.

City Gent

No, no, no, I don't follow this at all, I mean, I don't want to seem stupid but it looks to me as though I'm a pound down on the whole deal.

Mr Ford

Well, yes you are.

City Gent

I am! Well, what is my incentive to give you the pound?

Mr Ford

Well the incentive is - to make the orphans happy.

City Gent

genuinely puzzled

City Gent

Happy?... You quite sure you've got this right?

Mr Ford

Yes, lots of people give me money.

City Gent

What, just like that?

City Gent

Must be sick. I don't suppose you could give me a list of their names and addresses could you?

Mr Ford

No, I just go up to them in the street and ask.

City Gent

Good lord! That's the most exciting new idea I've heard in years! It's so simple it's brilliant! Well, if that idea of yours isn't worth a pound I'd like to know what is.

City Gent

he takes the tin from Ford

Mr Ford

Oh, thank you, sir.

City Gent

The only trouble is, you gave me the idea before I'd given you the pound. And that's not good business.

Mr Ford

Isn't it?

City Gent

No, I'm afraid it isn't. So, um, off you go.

City Gent

he pulls a lever opening a trap door under Ford's feet and Ford falls through with a yelp

City Gent

Nice to do business with you.

Cut briefly to a Mongol.

Mongol

Anyway.

Cut back to the banker.

City Gent

And off we go again.

City Gent

he goes to the intercom

City Gent

Ah Miss Godfrey could yould send in the pantomime horses please.

The door opens and two pantomime horses run in. Pantomime music. They do a routine including running round the room and bumping into each other. They then stand in front of the city gent crossing their legs and putting their heads on one side.

City Gent

Now I've asked you to ...

City Gent

they repeat the routine

City Gent

they start again

City Gent

they stop

City Gent

the pantomime horses heads go up, their ears waggle and their eyes go round

City Gent

water spurts out of their eyes in a stream

City Gent

the horses register surprise and generally behave ostentatiously

City Gent

Champion stamps his foot three times

City Gent

Trigger stamps his front foot twice and rear foot once

City Gent

one of the horses runs up to him and puts his head by the city gent's ear

City Gent

No, I'm afraid there's no redundancy scheme.

The horses turn and start kicking each other on the shins. After a few blows:

CAPTION: 'THE MAKERS OF THIS FILM WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE FOLLOWING PEOPLE WHO GAVE US LOTS OF MONEY TO SEE THEIR NAMES IN LIGHTS: VICTOR - HIS FRIEND BOBBY - AND - MARY

Pull back to show that 'Mary' is part of a sign saying: 'Mary Recruitment Office'. Pull out to reveal that it is a sign over a shop as for army recruiting office. An RSM with waxed moustache and snappy straight-against-the-forehead peaked cap comes out of the shop. He hangs a clearly printed sign on a nail on the door. It reads: 'Sketch just starting - actor wanted'.

Voice Over

Sketch just starting, actor wanted.

The RSM looks up and down the road, glances up at the sign above his shop without noticing it. He goes inside again. A man walks up, reads the sign and enters. He is Mr Man.

Mr Man

Good morning.

RSM

Morning, sir.

Mr Man

I'd like to join the army please.

RSM

I see. Short service or long service commission, sir?

Mr Man

As long as possible please.

RSM

Right well I'll just take a few particulars and then...

Suddenly he looks as though a dim memory has penetrated his skull. He breaks off, looking thoughtful, walks towards the door and exits. He comes out of shop, looks up at word 'Mary', tuts and changes the letters round to read 'Army'. He suddenly looks round and we see a queue of nuns.

RSM

Shove off!

RSM

he goes back inside

RSM

Then there'll be a few forms to sign, and of course we'll need references and then a full medical examination by the ...

Mr Man

Yes. Yes, yes I see.

Mr Man

diffidently

Mr Man

I was just wondering whether it would be possible for me to join... the women's army?

RSM

The Women's Royal Army Corps, sir?

Mr Man

Yes. I was just thinking, you know, if it was possible for me to have my choice ... I'd prefer to be in the Women's Royal Amy Corps.

RSM

Well, I'm afraid that the people that recruit here normally go straight into the Scots Guards.

Mr Man

Which is all... men... I suppose?

RSM

Yes it is.

Mr Man

Yes. Are there any regiments which are more effeminate than others?

RSM

Well, no sir. I mean, apart from the Marines, they're all dead butch.

Mr Man

You see, what I really wanted was a regiment where I could be really quiet and have more time to myself to work with fabrics, and creating new concepts in interior design.

RSM

Working with fabrics and experimenting with interior design!

Mr Man

Yes.

RSM

Oh well you want the Durham Light Infantry then, sir.

Mr Man

Oh.

RSM

Oh yes. That's the only regiment that's really doing something new with interior design, with colour, texture, line and that.

Mr Man

I see.

RSM

Oh yes, I mean their use of colour with fabrics is fantastic. I saw their pattern book the other day - beautiful, beautiful. Savage tans, great slabs of black set against aggressive orange. It really makes you want to shout out, this is good! This is real!

Mr Man

Really?

RSM

Oh yes. I mean the Inniskillin Fusiliers and the Anglian Regiment are all right if you're interested in the art nouveau William Morris revival bit, but if you really want a regiment of the line that is really saying something about interior decor, then you've got to go for the Durham Light Infantry.

Mr Man

Oh, I've had enough of this. I'm handing in my notice.

RSM

What do you mean?

Mr Man

Well I mean, when I applied for this job I thought I'd get a few decent lines but you end up doing the whole thing. I mean my last five speeches have been 'really, really - I see - I see' and 'really'. I wouldn't give those lines to a dog.

RSM

All right, all right, all right, sonny. I'll tell you what. We'll do something different. I'll be a bus conductor, and you can be a really funny passenger on a bus.

Cut to a bus set. There is a very bad backcloth of the interior of the top deck of a bus. It looks like the set for a rather tatty revue. On the cut Mr Man is standing in exactly the same place as he was - so that it looks as if the scene has changed around him. The RSM appears from one side. He is still dressed basically as an RSM but has a few bus conductor things such as a ticket machine, money satchel and a big arrow through his neck. He talks like a music-hall comedian.

RSM

Any more fares please? I've got a chauffeur and every time I go to the lavatory he drives me potty! Boom-boom! One in a row

RSM

sings

RSM

I'm not unusual. I'm just...

Mr Man

Fivepenny please.

RSM

Five beautiful pennies going in to the bag... and you are the lucky winner of... one fivepenny ticket!

RSM

hands him a ticket

RSM

brief film clip of audience laughing

Mr Man

Look!

RSM

I am looking - it's the only way I keep my eyelids apart! Boom-boom! Every one a Maserati!

Mr Man

Look! You said I was going to be a funny passenger.

RSM

snapping out of music-hall manner

RSM

What do you mean?

Mr Man

I mean, all I said was, fivepenny please, You can't call that a funny line.

RSM

Well it's the way you said it.

Mr Man

No it isn't. Nobody can say 'fivepenny please' and make it funny.

Cut to vox pop of city gent in a busy street.

City Gent

Fivepenny please.

Cut to stock film of audience rolling about with laughter and clapping. Cut back to vox pop of city gent in street. He looks rather bewildered. He shrugs, turns and as he starts to walk away the camera pulls out. We see the city gent pass two colleagues.

City Gent

Morning.

They collapse laughing and roll about on the pavement. The city gent hurries on, and turns into the door of a big office block. Cut to the foyer. A hall porter is standing behind a counter.

City Gent

Not so warm today, George.

A shriek of mirth from the porter who collapses behind the counter. The city gent continues walking into the lift. There are two other city gents and one secretary already in the lift. The doors shut.

Man's Voice

Good morning.

Secretary's Voice

Good morning.

City Gent's Voice

Good morning.

Shrieks of laughter. Cut to the doors of the lift on the third floor. Lift doors open and the city gent steps out rather quickly looking embarrassed. Behind him he leaves the three collapsed with mirth on the floor. The lift doors shut and the lift goes down again. Cut to interior of boss's office. A knock on the door. The boss is standing with his back to the door desperately preparing himself to keep a straight face.

Boss

Come in, Mr Horton.

The city gent enters.

City Gent

Morning, sir.

Boss

Do - do sit down.

Boss

he indicates chair, trying not to look at the city gent

City Gent

Thank you, sir.

The boss starts to snigger but suppresses it with feat of self-control.

Boss

Now then Horton, you've been with us for twenty years, and your work in the accounts department has been immaculate

Boss

the city gent starts to speak; the boss suppresses another burst of laughter

Boss

almost starts laughing

Boss

... has undermined the competence of this firm to such a point that I'm afraid that I've got no option but to sack you.

City Gent

in a broken voice

City Gent

the boss giggles, gets up hastily and turning his back on city gent leans against the mantelpiece; his desire to laugh mounts through the next speech

City Gent

It couldn't have come at a worse time. There's school fees for the two boys coming up, and the wife's treatment costing more now ... I don't know where the money's coming from as it is. And now I don't see any future ... I'd been hoping I'd be able to hang on here just for the last couple of years but... now ... I just want to go out and end it all.

The boss cannot control himself any longer. He collapses in helpless mirth, falling all over the room. Immediately we cut to stock film of terrific audience laughter.

Cut to backdrop of a circus ring. In front of it, as if in the ring, stand the RSM and Mr Man. Mr Man is as before. The RSM is dressed the same except that over his uniform he wears baggy trousers and braces and a funny nose. He is responding to the audience applause. Mr Man has obviously just been drenched with hot water - he is soaked and steam is rising.

RSM

Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you and now for the fish - the fish down the trousers.

RSM

the RSM picks up fish and puts it down Mr Man's trousers

RSM

the RSM pours a bucket of whitewash over him

RSM

more laughter, the RSM puts custard pie in his face and knees him in the balls

RSM

It's not my mush - it's your mush. It's your laugh - it's your laugh mate - not mine. It's your bleeding laugh.

Cut to stock film of Mr Heath laughing followed by stock film of Women's Institute applauding.

Mr Orbiter-5 is sitting in a swivel chair facing camera in a TV presentation set. Behind him is a set with enormous lettering which says 'Is the Queen sane?' Zoom in on Mr Orbiter-5. He starts talking immediately

Mr Orbiter

Good evening. Well tonight, we are going to talk about... well that is... I am going to talk about... well actually I am talking about it now... well I'm not talking about it now, but I am talking... I know I'm pausing occasionally, and not talking during the pauses, but the pauses are part of the whole process of talking... when one talks one has to pause... er ... like then! I paused ... but I was still talking ... and again there! No the real point of what I'm saying is that when I appear not to be talking don't go nipping out to the kitchen, putting the kettle on ... buttering scones... or getting crumbs and bits of food out of those round brown straw mats that the teapot goes on... because in all probability I'm still talking and what you heard was a pause ... er ... like there again. Look! To make it absolutely easier, so there's no problem at all, what I'll do, I'll give you some kind of sign, like this

Mr Orbiter

Jack

Good evening, I'm the announcer who's just been given this job by the BBC and I'd just like to say how grateful I am to the BBC for providing me with work, particularly at this time of year, when things are a bit thin for us announcers... um... I don't know whether I should tell you this, but, well, I have been going through a rather tough time recently. Things have been pretty awful at home. My wife, Josephine... 'Joe-jums' as I call her ... who is also an announcer...

Joe-jums

Hello.

Jack

... has not been able to announce since our youngest, Clifford, was born, and, well,

Jack

tearfully

Jack

he starts to sob

Dick

Hello, I'm another announcer, my name's Dick. Joe-jums just rang me and said Jack was having a bad time with this announcement, so I've just come to give him a hand. How is he, Joe-jums?

Joe-jums

Pretty bad, Dick.

Dick

Jack... it's Dick... Do you want me to make the announcement?

Jack

No, no Dick. I must do it myself...

Jack

emotionally

Jack

it's my last chance with the BBC, I can't throw it away... I've got to do it ... for Joe-jums... for the kids... I've got to go through with it...

Dick

Good man. Now remember your announcer's training: deep breaths, and try not to think about what you're saying...

Jack

Good evening. This

Jack

a trace of superhuman effort in his voice

Jack

is BBC 1...

Joe-jums

Good luck, Jack.

Dick

Keep going, old boy.

Jack

It's... nine o'clock... and... time... for... the News... read by... Richard Baker.

Cut to start of the 'Nine O'Clock News '.

Joe-jums

You've done it.

Dick

Congratulations, old man!

Richard Baker is sitting at a desk. As Richard Baker speaks we hear no sounds apart from the sounds of celebration of the announcers - champagne corks popping, etc. At the beginning of the news Baker uses the gesture between sentences that we have seen Mr Orbiter use, plus other gestures. Behind him on the screen a collage of photos appear one after the other: Richard Nixon, Tony Armstrong-Jones, the White House, Princess Margaret, parliament, naked breasts, a scrubbing brush, a man with a stoat through his head, Margaret Thatcher, a lavatory, a Scotsman lying on his back with his knees drawn up, a corkscrew, Edward Heath, a pair of false teeth in a glass. Whilst these have been going on Baker has been making gestures starting with elbow-up gesture and getting progressively more obscure and intriguing. We don't hear him at all, we hear all the announcers having a party and congratulating Jack.

Joe-jums

Fantastic darling, you were brilliant. No, no, it was the best you ever did.

Jack

Thank God.

Joe-jums

It was absolutely super.

Dick

... have a drink. For God's sake drink this...

Jack

Fantastic.

Dick

The least I could do - super - I must come over.

Jack

I can't tell you how much that means.

Jack

etc.

Eventually the voices stop and for the first time we hear Richard Baker's voice.

Baker

... until the name Maudling is almost totally obscured. That is the ned of the nicro-not wens. And now it's time for the late night film.

James Bond style opening titles with pictures of a pantomime horse.

THE PANTOMIME HORSE IS A SECRET AGENT FILM.

WRITTEN BY TALBOT ROTHWELL AND MIREILLE MATHIEU.

BASED ON AN IDEA BY EDWARD VII.

DIRECTED BY QUEEN JULIANA OF THE NETHERLANDS.

PRODUCED BY SIR ALEC DOUGLAS-HOME AND KING HAAKON OF NORWAY.

A CORPSE-HAKKON PRODUCTION.

Cut to an idyllic scene - a boat drifting serenely on a river. A beautiful girl lies reclining in one end of the boat. A hoof appears round Carol's shoulders.

Girl

Oh pantomime horse, that was wonderful.

Dobbin

Would you like another glass?

Girl

No, no, I mustn't. It makes me throw up... oh, I'm so bleeding happy.

Dobbin

Oh, Simone!

Girl

Oh, pantomime horse.

Cut to Graham in loony get up.

Loony

Then...

The pantomime horse spins round and fires his revolver towards some trees overhanging the water. Another pantomime horse falls out of the tree into the water. A third pantomime horse scurries out from behind a bush and runs off into the undergrowth. Dobbin leaps out of the boat. The girl jumps after him. A car drives out of some bushes on to the road and accelerates away. The pantomime horse is in it. Dobbin and the girl leap into their own expensive sports car and give chase. Shots of exciting chase. After two or three shots of the cars chasing, the two pantomime horses are seen on two tandems, continuing the chase. Cut to them chasing each other on horseback. Cut to them chasing each other on rickshaws. Cut to them chasing each other on foot.

Voice Over

And now the English pantomime horse has very nearly caught up with the Russian pantomime horse, I think he's going to take him any moment now but what is this? What is this?

Voice Over

round the corner are waiting a pantomime goose and a pantomime Princess Margaret; the Russian pantomime horse runs past them and they leap on the English pantomime horse and a fight starts

Voice Over

a car draws up and Terence Rattigan and the Duke of Kent and the RSM run up and join in the fighting; the Russians are joined by Heinz Sielmann and Peter Scott and Jacques Cousteau

My goodness me it's the Duke of Kent to the rescue...

Here you see some English comic actors engaged in a life or death struggle with a rather weak ending. This is typical of the zany madcap world of the irresistible kooky funsters. The English pantomime horse wins and so is assured of a place in British history and a steady job in a merchant bank. Unfortunately, before his pension rights are assured, he catches bronchitis and dies, another victim of the need to finish these shows on time.

The hall of the Memorial Baths, Swansea, done up for a gala occasion. There is a stage with flags, bunting and flowers. Echoing noise of audience anticipation. Muffled tannoy announcements in background.

Voice Over

Good evening, and welcome to the Arthur Ludlow Memorial Baths, Newport, for this year's finals of the All-England Summarize Proust Competition.

Voice Over

pull back slightly to reveal big banner across the top of the stage: 'All-England Summarize Proust Competition'

Voice Over

Voice Over

Alec and Eric Bedser, ex-Surrey cricketers, Stewart Surridge, ex-captain of Surrey, Omar Sharif, Laurie Fishlock, ex-Surrey opening batsman, Peter May, the former Surrey and England Captain, and Yehudi Menuhin, the world-famous violinist and the President of the Surrey Cricket Club. And right now it's time to meet your host for tonight Arthur Mee!

Showbiz music, applause, and Arthur Mee appears from the back of the stage; he wears the now traditional spangly jacket. He comes forward and speaks into the mike (the sound is rather hollow and strident as in big halls with a hastily rigged PA).

Mee

Good evening and welcome, whereas Proust would say, 'la malade imaginaire de recondition et de toute surveillance est bientôt la même chose'.

Mee

roars of applause; quick shot of grinning faces of the jury

Mee

curtain pulls back at back of stage to reveal a true, enormous, but cheap, audience appreciation gauge; it lists the seven books of Proust's masterwork in the form of a thermometer

Mee

Harry Bagot, in evening dress, comes forward from back of stage, he has a number three on his back; Mee leads the applause for him

Mee

now

Mee

Music starts, continuity-type music. The needle of the Proustometer creeps up almost inperceptibly to a tiny level.

Harry

Proust's novel ostensibly tells of the irrevocability of time lost, the forfeiture of innocence through experience, the reinstallment of extra-temporal values of time regained, ultimately the novel is both optimistic and set within the context of a humane religious experience, re-stating as it does the concept of intemporality. In the first volume, Swarm, the family friend visits...

Gong goes, chord of music, applause. The meter has hardly risen at all.

Mee

Well tried, Harry.

Voice Over

A good attempt there but unfortunately he chose a general appraisal of the work, before getting on to the story and as you can see

Voice Over

close up of Proustometer

he only got as far as page one of 'Swarm's Way', the first of the seven volumes. A good try though and very nice posture.

Cut back to the stage.

Mee

Harry Bagot, you're from Luton?

Harry

Yes, Arthur, yeah.

Mee

Now Harry what made you first want to try and start summarizing Proust?

Harry

Well I first entered a seaside Summarizing Proust Competition when I was on holiday in Bournemouth, and my doctor encouraged me with it.

Mee

And Harry, what are your hobbies outside summarizing?

Harry

Well, strangling animals, golf and masturbating.

Mee

Well, thank you Harry Bagot.

Harry walks off-stage. Music and applause.

Voice Over

Well there he goes. Harry Bagot. He must have let himself down a bit on the hobbies, golf's not very popular around here, but never mind, a good try.

Mee

Thank you ladies and gentlemen. Mr Rutherford from Leicester, are you ready Ronald?

Mee

Ronald is a very eager man in tails

Mee

Right. On the summarizing spot. You have got fifteen seconds from now.

Ronald

Er, well, Swann, Swann, there's this house, there's this house, and er, it's in the morning, it's in the morning - no, it's the evening, in the evening and er, there's a garden and er, this bloke comes in - bloke comes in - what's his name - what's his name, er just said it - big bloke - Swann, Swann

The gong sounds. Mee pushes Ronald out.

Mee

And now ladies and gentlemen, I'd like you to welcome the last of our all-England finalists this evening, from Bingley, the Bolton Choral Society and their leader Superintendent McGough,

Mee

a big choir comes on, immaculately drilled, each holding a score, with Fred Tomlinson as superintendent McGough

Mee

All right Bingley, remember you've got fifteen seconds to summarize Proust in his entirety starting from now.

Mee

Well ladies and gentlemen, I don't think any of our contestants this evening have succeeded in encapsulating the intricacies of Proust's masterwork, so I'm going to award the first prize this evening to the girl with the biggest tits.

Applause and music. A lady with enormous knockers comes on to the side of the stage. Roll credits:

Roll usual Monty Python credits and music. Behind them the lady accepts the cup and the singers come back on stage and admire her. Fade out. Slight pause. Fade up on stock film of Everest. Whistling wind, stirring music.

Voice Over

Mount Everest. Forbidding. Aloof. Terrifying. The mountain with the biggest tits in the world.

Sound of gong.

Second Voice Over

Start again!

A very silly loony leans into shot, on overlay (i.e. in front of the picture), and waves to the camera. He goes out of shot again.

Voice Over

Mount Everest. Forbidding. Aloof. Terrifying. This year, this remote Himalayan mountain, this mystical temple, surrounded by the most difficult terrain in the world, repulsed yet another attempt to conquer it. This time, by the International Hairdresser's Expedition.

Voice Over

In such freezing, adverse conditions, man comes very close to breaking point. What was the real cause of the disharmony which destroyed their chances at success?

Cut to three head-and-shoulders shots. They look like typical mountaineers: frost in their beards, tanned, with snow glasses on their foreheads and authentic Everest headgear.

First Climber

Well, people would keep taking my hairdryer and never returning it.

Second Climber

There was a lot of bitching in the tents.

Third Climber

You couldn't get near the mirror.

Cut to a colonel figure, digging in a garden in Jersey.

Voice Over

The leader of the expedition was Colonel Sir John 'Teasy-Weasy' Butler, veteran of K2, Annapurna, and Vidals. His plan was to ignore the usual route around the South Col and to make straight for the top.

Cut to a photo of Everest with dots superimposed, showing the route.

Colonel

We established base salon here,

Colonel

on the photos, we see the words 'base salon'

Colonel

at the top of the route we see 'Mario's'

Colonel

From here using crampons and cutting ice steps as we went, we moved steadily up the Lhotse Face to the North Ridge, establishing camp three where we could get a hot meal, a manicure, and a shampoo and set.

Cut to stock film of people actually climbing Everest.

Voice Over

Could it work? Could this eighteen-year old hairdresser from Brixton succeed where others had failed? The situation was complicated by the imminent arrival of the monsoon storms. Patrice takes up the story.

Cut to interior of hairdresser's salon. Patrice speaks into the mirror, as he is blow-drying and curling a lady's hair.

Patrice

Well, we knew as well as anyone that the monsoons were due, but the thing was, Ricky and I had just had a blow dry and rinse, and we couldn't go out for a couple of days.

Cut to stock film of some people leaving a little tent on a mountain.

Voice Over

After a blazing row, the Germans and Italians had turned back, taking with them the last of the hair nets. On the third day a blizzard blew up.

Voice Over

close up on the tent in a blizzard; no people in shot

Voice Over

Temperatures fell to minus thirty centigrade. Inside the little tent, things were getting desperate.

We cut inside the tent. The wind is banging against the side of the material, sounds of a vicious blizzard. Ricky is sitting next to another member of the expedition. Both are under hairdryers, in full climbing gear up to their necks. One is reading Vogue. Ricky is doing his nails.

Ricky

Well, things have got so bad that we've been forced to use the last of the heavy oxygen equipment just to keep the dryers going.

Ricky

Oh, she's a treas.

Cut to a wide shot of Everest.

But a new factor had entered the race. A team of French chiropodists, working with brand new cornplasters and Doctor Scholl's Mountaineering Sandals, were covering ground fast. The Glasgow Orpheus Male Voice Choir were tackling the difficult North Col.

Well, he decided to open a salon.

It was a tremendous success.

Challenging Everest? Why not drop in at Ricky Pules' - only 24,000 feet from this cinema. Ricky and Maurice offer a variety of styles for the well-groomed climber. Like Sherpa Tensing and Sir Edmond Hillary be number one on top, when you're Number One on Top?

Animated sketch leads to little old Mrs Little on the phone in her hall. She is a dear little old lady and lives in a rather fussy ducks-on-wall house.

Mrs Little

Hello, is that the fire brigade?

Cut to the fire station.

First Fireman

No, sorry, wrong number.

He puts the phone back. Pull out to reveal four or five firemen in full gear, surrounded by fire-fighting equipment and a gleaming fire engine. The firemen are engaged in a variety of homely pursuits: one is soldering a crystal set, another is cooking at a workbench, another is doing embroidery, another is at a sewing machine. The first fireman is at the phone on the wall. He goes back to clearing up a budgie's cage.

Second Fireman

That phone's not stopped ringing all day.

Third Fireman

What happens when you've mixed the batter, do you dice the ham with the coriander?

First Fireman

No, no, you put them in separately when the vine leaves are ready.

The phone rings.

Second Fireman

Oh, no, not again.

Third Fireman

Take it off the hook.

The first fireman takes the phone off the hook. Cut back to Mrs Little on phone. She looks at the receiver then listens again.

Mrs Little

I can't get the fire brigade Mervyn.

Mervyn, her 38-year-old, 6' 8" son appears.

Mervyn

Here, let me try, dear. You go and play the cello.

Mrs Little

Oh it doesn't do any good, dear.

Mervyn

Look. Do you want the little hamster to live or not?

Mrs Little

Yes I do, Mervyn.

Mervyn

Well go and play the cello!

She looks helplessly at him, then goes into the sitting room. Mervyn dials.

Mervyn

Hello, hello, operator? Yes we're trying to get the fire brigade ... No, the fire brigade. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, what? ...

Mervyn

he takes one of his shoes off and looks in it

Mervyn

Size eight. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, no of course not, Yes...

Mrs Little appears, dabbing at her eyes with a handkerchief.

Mrs Little

touching Mervyn gently on the arm

Mrs Little

He's gone, dear.

Mervyn

What?

Mrs Little

He's slipped away.

Mrs Little

The sodding hamster's dead!

Mervyn

broken

Mervyn

Oh no!! What were you playing?

Mrs Little

Some Mozart concertos, dear.

Mervyn

What... How did he... ?

Mrs Little

His eyes just closed, and he fell into the wastepaper basket. I've covered him with a copy of the 'Charlie George Football Book'.

Mervyn

handing her the phone

Mervyn

Right, you hang on. I must go and see him.

Mrs Little

There was nothing we could do, Mervyn. If we'd have had the whole Philharmonic Orchestra in there, he'd still have gone.

Mervyn

I'm going upstairs, I can't bear it.

Mrs Little

restraining him

Mrs Little

There isn't an upstairs dear, it's a bungalow.

Mervyn

Damn.

Mervyn

he storms off

Mrs Little

into the phone

Mrs Little

she takes her shoe off and looks inside

Mrs Little

size three, yes it's just - we've lost a dear one and my son was ... yes, that's right, size eight, yes and... Oh I see... yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, I see, yes, yes, I, I ... Yes, yes. No ... no... yes, I see. They can't get the fire brigade Mervyn - will the Boys' Brigade do?

Mervyn

off

Mervyn

No! They'd be useless!

Mrs Little

No, he doesn't want anyone at the moment, thank you. No, yes, yes, no thank you for trying, yes, yes, ... no, Saxones, yes, yes thank you, bye, bye.

As she puts the phone down the front door beside her opens and there stands a huge African warrior in war paint and with a spear and shield. At his feet are several smart suitcases.

Eamonn

Mummy!

Mrs Little

Eamonn.

Mrs Little

he brings in the cases and closes the front door

Mrs Little

Mervyn! Look it's our Eamonn - oh let me look at you, tell me how... how is it in Dublin?

Eamonn

Well, things is pretty bad there at the moment but there does seem some hope of a constitutional settlement.

Mrs Little

Oh don't talk. Let me just look at you.

Eamonn

Great to be home, mummy. How are you?

Mrs Little

Oh, I'm fine. I must just go upstairs and get your room ready.

Eamonn

It's a bungalow, mummy.

Mrs Little

Oh damn, yes. Mervyn, Mervyn - look who's here, it's our Eamonn come back to see us.

Mervyn appears. He still looks shattered by the death of the hamster.

Mervyn

Hello, Eamonn.

Eamonn

Hello, Merv.

Mervyn

How was Dublin?

Eamonn

Well as I was telling mummy here, things is pretty bad there at the moment but there does seem some hope of a constitutional settlement.

The phone rings.

Mervyn

answering phone

Mervyn

looking at Eamonn's bare foot

Mervyn

Size seven. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes .... it's the fire brigade, they want to know if they can come round Thursday evening.

Mrs Little

Oh no, Thursday's the Industrial Relations Bill Dinner Dance. Can't they make it another day?

Mervyn

into the phone

Mervyn

fade out

Fade up on a dinner-jacketed announcer sitting at a table with a bowl of flowers on it. A hand waves from inside the bowl of flowers.

Announcer

And so it was the fire brigade eventually came round on Friday night.

Cut to fire engines skidding out of the fire station and roaring away - speeded up. They skid to a halt outside the Littles' suburban house. Firemen pour out of the fire engine and start to swarm in through the windows. Cut to interior of Littles' sitting room. It is laid out for a cocktail party. Mervyn is in evening dress and is sitting on the sofa looking very depressed. Mrs Little in a faded cocktail dress. Eamonn still in warpaint with spear and shield. The firemen appear.

Mrs Little

Oh, so glad you could come. What would you like to drink? Gin and tonic? Sherry?

Firemen

in unison

Firemen

as she starts to pour drinks the firemen confide in unison

Firemen

We do like being called out to these little parties, they're much better than fires.

The phone rings. Half the firemen go to answer it.

A Fireman

A Fireman

Yes, yes yes.

Firemen

Well, how was Dublin, Eamonn?

Eamonn

Veronica

Hello, Last week on 'Party Hints' I showed you how to make a small plate of goulash go round twenty-six people, how to get the best out of your canapés, and how to unblock your loo. This week I'm going to tell you what to do if there is an armed communist uprising near your home when you're having a party. Well obviously it'll depend how far you've got

Veronica

with

Veronica

your party when the signal for Red Revolt is raised. If you're just having preliminary aperitifs - Dubonnet, a sherry or a sparkling white wine - then the guests will obviously be in a fairly formal mood and it will be difficult to tell which are the communist agitators. So the thing to do is to get some cloth and some bits of old paper, put it down on the floor and shoot everybody. This will deal with the Red Menace on your own doorstep. If you're having canapés, as I showed you last week, or an outdoor barbecue, then the thing to do is to set fire to all houses in the street. This will stir up anti-communist hatred and your neighbours will be right with you as you organize counter-revolutionary terror. So you see, if you act promptly enough, any left-wing uprising can be dealt with by the end of the party. Bye...

ANIMATION:

one dozen communist revolutions.

Then cut to a language laboratory. Mr Mann is showing Tick round. There is a line of booths, each lined with pegboard. Each has a person with a pair of earphones on with attached microphones, a tape recorder and a swivel chair.

First Booth

Bleck people. Bleck people. Rrrhodesian. Kill the blecks. Rrhodesian. Smith, Smith. Kill the blecks within the five principles.

He starts to rewind the tape recorder. Nods at Mr Mann. They come to the second booth.

Second Booth

I'm afraid I cannot comment on that until it's been officially hushed up.

Mr Mann

This is our politicians booth.

Second Booth

While there is no undue cause for concern, there is certainly no room for complacency. Ha, ha, ha. He, he, he.

They pass on to the next booth.

Third Booth

Well I'll go, I'll go to the foot of our stairs. Ee ecky thump. Put wood in 'ole, muther.

Mr Mann taps him. He removes his earphones.

Looks jolly good.

They come to the fourth booth where sits a very city-type gent.

Fourth Booth

Hello, big boy.

Fourth Booth

Fourth Booth

Oo varda the ome. D'you want a nice time?

Mr Mann

Very good.

Fourth Booth

They pass the fifth booth, whose occupant is making silly noises.

Mr Mann

And we control everything from here.

Mr Mann

indicating the control desk

Tick

Superb.

Mr Mann

Well then what sort of thing were you looking for?

Tick

Well, er, really something to make me a little less insignificant?

Mr Mann

Oh, I see sort of 'Now look here, you may be Chairman but your bloody pusillanimous behaviour makes me vomit!' That sort of thing?...

Tick

Oh no, no, no, not really no.

Mr Mann

Oh I see, well perhaps something a bit more sort of Clive Jenkins-ish? Perhaps - sort of

Mr Mann

Welsh accent

Mr Mann

'Mr Smarmy so-called Harold Wilson can call himself pragmatic until he's blue in the breasts'.

Tick

Oh no, I really want something that will make people be attracted to me like a magnet.

Mr Mann

I see, well, you want our 'Life and Soul of the Party' tape then, I think.

Tick

What's that?

Mr Mann

Well it's sort of 'Ello squire, haven't seen you for a bit, haven't seen you for a bit either, Beryl. Two pints of wallop please, love. Still driving the Jensen then? Cheer up Jack it may never happen, what's your poison then?'

Tick

Fantastic, yes.

Mr Mann

Right, I'll just see if we've got the tape.

He puts the headphones on. Whilst he looks away, the whole of the back wall of people in booths, swing round on their chairs and do a little thirties routine, with their earphones on, kicking their legs, etc., they sing.

The loony leans into shot and waves. Fade to black. Fade up on close up of picture of Everest. Pull back to reveal travel agent's office.

Bounder

Mount Everest, forbidding, aloof, terrifyring. The highest place on earth. No I'm sorry we don't go there. No.

By the time Bounder is saying his last sentence the camera has revealed the office and Bounder himself sitting at a desk. Bounder now replaces the telephone into which he has been speaking. After a pause the tourist - Mr Smoke-Too-Much - enters the office and approaches Mr Bounder's secretary.

Tourist

Good morning.

Secretary

Oh good morning.

Secretary

sexily

Secretary

Do you want to go upstairs?

Tourist

What?

Secretary

brightly

Secretary

Or have you come to arrange a holiday?

Tourist

Er.......to arrange a holiday.

Secretary

Oh sorry.

Tourist

What's all this about going upstairs?

Secretary

Oh, nothing, nothing. Now where were you thinking of going?

Tourist

India.

Secretary

Ah one of our adventure holidays!

Tourist

Yes!

Secretary

Well you'd better see Mr Bounder about that. Mr Bounder, this gentleman is interested in the India Overland.

Walks over to Bounder's desk where he is greeted by Bounder.

Bounder

Ah good morning. I'm Bounder of Adventure.

Tourist

My name is Smoke-Too-Much.

Bounder

What?

Tourist

My name is Smoke-Too-Much. Mr Smoke-Too-Much.

Bounder

Well you'd better cut down a little then.

Bounder

You'd better cut down a little then.

Tourist

Oh I see! Cut down a bit, for Smoke-Too-Much.

Bounder

Yes, he he...I expect you get people making jokes about your name all the time, eh?

Tourist

No, no actually. Actually, it never struck me before. Smoke...too...much!

Bounder

Anyway, you're interested in one of our adventure holidays, eh?

Tourist

Yes. I saw your advert in the bolour supplement.

Bounder

The what?

Tourist

The bolour supplement.

Bounder

The colour supplement?

Tourist

Yes. I'm sorry I can't say the letter 'B'.

Bounder

C?

Tourist

Yes that's right. It's all due to a trauma I suffered when I was a sboolboy. I was attacked by a bat.

Bounder

A cat?

Tourist

No a bat.

Bounder

Can you say the letter 'K'?

Tourist

Oh yes, Khaki, king, kettle, Kuwait, Keble Bollege Oxford.

Bounder

Why don't you say the letter 'K' instead of the letter 'C'?

Tourist

What you mean.....spell bolour with a K?

Bounder

Yes.

Tourist

Kolour. Oh that's very good, I never thought of that.

Bounder

Anyway, about the holiday..

Tourist

Well I saw your adverts in the paper and I've been on package tours several times, you see, and I decided that this was for me.

Bounder

Ah good.

Tourist

Yes I quite agree with you, I mean what's the point of being treated like a sheep, I mean I'm fed up with going abroad and being treated like a sheep, what's the point of being carted around in buses surrounded by sweaty mindless oafs from Kettering and Boventry in their cloth caps and their cardigans and their transistor radios and their 'Sunday Mirrors', complaining about the tea, 'Oh they don't make it properly here do they not like at home' stopping at Majorcan bodegas, selling fish and chips and Watney's Red Barrel and calamares and two veg and sitting in cotton sun frocks squirting Timothy White's suncream all over their puffy raw swollen purulent flesh cos they 'overdid it on the first day'!

Bounder

agreeing patiently

Bounder

Yes. Absolutely, yes, I quite agree...

Tourist

And being herded into endless Hotel Miramars and Bellvueses and Bontinentals with their international luxury modern roomettes and their Watney's Red Barrel and their swimming pools full of fat German businessmen pretending they're acrobats and forming pyramids and frightening the children and barging in to the queues and if you're not at your table spot on seven you miss your bowl of Campbell's Cream of Mushroom soup, the first item on the menu of International Cuisine, and every Thursday night there's a bloody cabaret in the bar featuring some tiny emaciated dago with nine-inch hips and some big fat bloated tart with her hair brylcreemed down and a big arse presenting Flamenco for Foreigners.

Bounder

beginning to get fed up

Bounder

Yes, yes, now...

Tourist

And then some adenoidal typists from Birmingham with diarrhoea and flabby white legs and hairy bandy-legged wop waiters called Manuel, and then, once a week there's an excursion to the local Roman ruins where you can buy cherryade and melted ice cream and bleedin' Watney's Red Barrel, and one night they take you to a local restaurant with local colour and colouring and they show you there and you sit next to a party of people from Rhyl who keeps singing 'Torremolinos, Torremolinos' and complaining about the food - 'Oh! It's so greasy isn't it?' and then you get cornered by some drunken greengrocer from Luton with an Instamatic and Dr Scholl sandals and last Tuesday's 'Daily Express' and he drones on and on and on about how Mr. Smith should be running this country and how many languages Enoch Powell can speak and then he throws up all over the Cuba Libres.

Bounder

Will you be quiet please.

Tourist

And sending tinted postcards of places they don't know they haven't even visited, 'to all at number 22, weather wonderful, our room is marked with an "X". Wish you were here.'

Bounder

Shut up.

Tourist

'Food very greasy but we have managed to find this marvellous little place hidden away in the back streets.'

Bounder

Shut up!

Tourist

'Where you can even get Watney's Red Barrel and cheese and onion...'

Bounder

Shut up!!!

Tourist

'...crisps and the accordionist plays "Maybe it's because I'm a Londoner"' and spending four days on the tarmac at Luton airport on a five-day package tour with nothing to eat but dried Watney's sandwhiches....

Bounder

Shut your bloody gob! I've had enough of this, I'm going to ring the police.

He dials and waits. Cut to a corner of a police station. One policeman is knitting, another is making a palm tree out of old newspapers. The phone rings.

Knitting Policeman

Oh...take it off the hook.

Knitting Policeman

they do so

Cut back to travel agent's office. The man is still going on, the travel agent looks crossly at the phone and puts it down. Then picks it up and dials again.

Bounder

Hello operator, operator...I'm trying to get the police...the police yes, what?

Bounder

takes off his shoe and looks inside

Bounder

nine and a half, nine and a half, yes, yes...I see...well can you keep trying please...

Through all this the tourist is still going on:

Tourist

...and there's nowhere to sleep and the kids are vomitting and throwing up on the plastic flowers and they keep telling you it'll only be another hour although your plane is still in Iceland waiting to take some Swedes to Yugoslavia before it can pick you up on the tarmac at 3 a.m. in the bloody morning and you sit on the tarmac till six because of 'unforeseen difficulties'. i.e. the permanent strike of Air Traffic Control in Paris, and nobody can go to the lavatory until you take off at eight, and when you get to Malaga airport everybody's swallowing Enterovioform tablets and queuing for the toilets and when you finally get to the hotel, there's no water in the taps, there's no water in the pool, there's no water in the bog and there's a bleeding lizard in the bidet, and half the rooms are double-booked and you can't sleep anyway...

The secretary comes up and looks into the camera.

Secretary

Oh! Sorry to keep you waiting...will you come this way please...

The camera follows her as she leads us out of the office, with agent and client still rabbitting on, down a short passage to a documentary interview set where the two participants are sitting waiting. We follow her into the set.

Secretary

Here they are.

Secretary

she turns to the camera again, which moves a little towards her, as if waiting to be summoned

Secretary

Just here will do fine! Goodbye.

Exactly.

What is it?

Where?

Presenter

No, no your new theory?

Presenter

I

Presenter

am

Miss Elk

Good for you. My word yes. Well Chris, what is it that it is - this theory of mine. Well, this is what it is - my theory that I have, that is to say, which is mine, is mine.

Miss Elk

This is how it goes. The next thing I'm going to say is my theory. Ready?

Presenter

Yes!

Miss Elk

My Theory by A. Elk. Brackets Miss, brackets. This theory goes as follows and begins now. All brontosauruses are thin at one end, much much thicker in the middle, and then thin again at the far end. That is my theory, it is mine, and belongs to me and I own it, and what it is too.

Presenter

That's

Presenter

it

Presenter

, is it?

Miss Elk

Spot on, Chris.

Presenter

Well, er, this theory of yours seems to have hit the nail on the head.

Miss Elk

And it's mine.

Yes, thank you for coming along to the studio. Thank you.

Miss Elk

My pleasure, Chris...

Thank you. Britain's newest wasp farm...

Miss Elk

This second theory which was the one that I had said...

Presenter

the phone rings; he answers

Presenter

Yes, no I'm trying...

Miss Elk

Which I could expound without doubt. This second theory which, with the one which I have said, forms the brace of theories which I own and which belongs to me, goes like this...

Presenter

looking at  his shoe

Presenter

Miss Elk

This is what it is.

Miss Elk

Presenter

Miss Elk

This is it...

Miss Elk

He rises and leaves the set to go next door to the travel agent set, leaving Miss Elk behind for a moment. Bounder is still on the phone. His other phone rings; he answers it.

Bounder

Hello, yes,,,yes,,,

The presenter enters the travel set. The tourist is still droning on as before and Bounder is still on the phone.

Tourist

Tourist

...and the Spanish Tourist Board promises you that the raging cholera epidemic is merely a case of mild Spanish tummy, like the last outbreak of Spanish tummy in 1660 which killed half London and decimated Europe, and meanwhile the bloody Guardia are busy arresting sixteen-year-olds for kissing in the streets and shooting anyone under nineteen who doesn't like Franco...

The presenter approaches Bounder.

Presenter

The fire brigade are here. They're coming.

Bounder

Hello! No, no, no I think they are all part of the British Shoe Corporation now.

Miss Elk follows the presenter in.

Miss Elk

Chris, this other theory of mine which is mine like the other one I also own. The second theory...

The fire brigade enter and the secretary goes to greet them. They speak to her and she takes off her shoe to check the size. Meanwhile...

Miss Elk

My second theory states that fire brigade choirs seldom sing songs about Marcel Proust.

With only a half-beat pause the fire brigade start singing the Proust song. After the usual number of lines we hear the gong.

he goes up to the antique desk and bangs the bell violently; he smashes the intercom and generally breaks the desk up

T. F. Gumby

No, no, I am not the brain specialist. No, no, I am not... Yes. Yes I am.

He raises a gas cylinder and strikes Gumby hard over the head with it. Bong. Blackness. Into the oblivion of animation.

Then cut to an ordinary suburban living room. Mr and Mrs Jalin are sitting on a sofa. The previous item in the show is visible on their TV set. Mrs Jalin is stuffing a chicken. Mr Jalin is reading the telephone directory. The picture changes and we hear voice from TV.

Mr Jalin picks up a jousting ball and chain and smashes the TV set. There is a ring from the doorbell. Mr Jalin sits, Mrs Jalin goes to the door, exits and comes back.

Mrs Jalin

Mr Jalin

Mrs Jalin

There's a man at the door with a moustache.

Mr Jalin

Tell him I've already got one.

Mr Jalin

Mrs Jalin hits him hard with a newspaper

Mr Jalin

All right, all right. What's he want then?

Mrs Jalin

He says do we want a documentary on molluscs.

Mr Jalin

Molluscs?!

Mrs Jalin

Yes.

Mr Jalin

What's he mean, molluscs?

Mrs Jalin

MOLLUSCS!! GASTROPODS! LAMELLIBRANCHS! CEPHALOPODS!

Mr Jalin

Oh molluscs, I thought you said bacon.

Mr Jalin

she hits him again

Mr Jalin

All right, all right. What's he charge then?

Mrs Jalin

It's free.

Mr Jalin

Ooh! Where does he want us to sit?

Mrs Jalin

calling through the door

Mrs Jalin

He says yes.

Mr Zorba enters carrying plywood flat with portion cut out to represent TV. He stands behind flat and starts.

Zorba

Good evening. Tonight molluscs. The mollusc is a soft-bodied, unsegmented invertebrate animal usually protected by a large shell. One of the most numerous groups of invertebrates, it is exceeded in number of species only by the arthropods ... viz.

Zorba

he holds up a lobster

Mrs Jalin

Not very interesting is it?

Zorba

What?

Mrs Jalin

I was talking to him.

Zorba

Oh. Anyway, the typical mollusc, viz, a snail

Zorba

holds one up

Zorba

consists of a prominent muscular portion... the head-foot... a visceral mass and a shell which is secreted by the free edge of the mantle.

Mrs Jalin

Dreadful isn't it?

Zorba

Oh. Well anyway... in some molluscs, however, viz, slugs,

Zorba

the shell is absent or rudimentary...

Mr Jalin

Switch him off.

Mrs Jalin gets up and looks for the switch unsuccessfully.

Zorba

Whereas in others, viz, cephalopods the head-foot is greatly modified and forms tentacles, viz, the squid.

Zorba

looking out

Zorba

What are you doing?

Mrs Jalin

Switching you off.

Zorba

Why, don't you like it?

Mrs Jalin

Oh it's dreadful.

Mr Jalin

Embarrassing.

Zorba

Is it?

Mrs Jalin

Yes, it's perfectly awful.

Mr Jalin

Disgraceful! I don't know how they've got the nerve to put it on.

Mrs Jalin

It's so boring.

Zorba

Well ... it's not much of a subject is it... be fair.

Mrs Jalin

What do you think, George?

Mr Jalin

Give him another twenty seconds.

Zorba

Anyway the majority of the molluscs are included in three large groups, the gastropods, the lamellibranchs and the cephalopods...

Mrs Jalin

We knew that

Mrs Jalin

she gets up and goes to the set

Zorba

However, what is more interesting, er ... is the molluscs's er ... sex life.

Mrs Jalin

stopping dead

Mrs Jalin

Oh!

Zorba

Yes, the mollusc is a randy little fellow whose primitive brain scarcely strays from the subject of the you know what.

Mrs Jalin

going back to sofa

Mrs Jalin

Disgusting!

Mr Jalin

Ought not to be allowed.

Zorba

The randiest of the gastropods is the limpet. This hot-blooded little beast with its tent-like shell is always on the job. Its extra-marital activities are something startling. Frankly I don't know how the female limpet finds the time to adhere to the rock-face. How am I doing?

Mrs Jalin

Disgusting.

Mr Jalin

But more interesting.

Mrs Jalin

Oh yes, tch, tch, tch.

Zorba

Another loose-living gastropod is the periwinkle. This shameless little libertine with its characteristic ventral locomotion ... is

Zorba

not

Zorba

the marrying kind: 'Anywhere anytime' is its motto. Up with the shell and they're at it.

Mrs Jalin

How about the lamellibranchs?

Zorba

I'm coming to them ... the great scallop

Zorba

holds up a clam

Zorba

This latter is a right whore, a harlot, a trollop, a cynical bed-hopping firm-breasted Rabelaisian bit of sea food that makes Fanny Hill look like a dead Pope... and finally among the lamellibranch bivalves, that most depraved of the whole sub-species - the whelk. The whelk is nothing but a homosexual of the worst kind. This gay boy of the gastropods, this queer crustacean, this mincing mollusc, this screaming, prancing, limp-wristed queen of the deep makes me sick.

Mrs Jalin

Have you got one?

Zorba

Here!

Mrs Jalin

Let's kill it. Disgusting.

Zorba throws it on the floor and Mr and Mrs Jalin stamp on it.

Mr Jalin

That'll teach it. Well thank you for a very interesting programme.

Zorba

Oh, not at all. Thank you.

Mrs Jalin

Yes, that was very nice.

Zorba

Thank you.

Zorba

Second Interviewer

Hello. I'm sorry about my colleague's rather unconventional behaviour just now, but things haven't been too easy for him recently, trouble at home, rather confidential so I can't give you all the details... interesting though they are... three bottles of rum with his Weetabix, and so on, anyway... apparently the girl wasn't even ... anyway the activity you see behind me... it's the mother I feel sorry for. I'll start again. The activity you see behind me is part of the preparations for the new Naval Expedition to Lake Pahoe. The man in charge of this expedition is Vice Admiral Sir John Cunningham. Sir John, hello there.

Sir John

Ah, hello. Well first of all I'd like to apologize for the behaviour of certain of my colleagues you may have seen earlier, but they are from broken homes, circus families and so on and they are in no way representative of the new modern improved British Navy. They are a small vociferous minority; and may I take this opportunity of emphasizing that there is no cannibalism in the British Navy. Absolutely none, and when I say none, I mean there is a certain amount, more than we are prepared to admit, but all new ratings are warned that if they wake up in the morning and find any toothmarks at all anywhere on their bodies, they're to tell me immediately so that I can immediately take every measure to hush the whole thing up. And, finally, necrophilia is right out.

Sir John

the interviewer keeps nodding but looks embarrassed

Sir John

Now, this expedition is primarily to investigate reports of cannibalism and necrophilia in... this expedition is primarily to investigate reports of unusual marine life in the as yet uncharted Lake Pahoe.

Second Interviewer

And where exactly is the lake?

Sir John

Er 22A, Runcorn Avenue, I think. Yes, that's right, 22A.

Second Interviewer

Runcorn Avenue?

Sir John

Yes, it's just by Blenheim Crescent... do you know it?

Second Interviewer

You mean it's in an ordinary street?

Sir John

Of course it's not an ordinary street! It's got a lake in it!

Second Interviewer

Yes but I...

Sir John

Look, how many streets do you know that have got lakes in them?

Second Interviewer

But you mean... is it very large?

Sir John

Of

Sir John

course

Sir John

Sir John

Jenkins ... no!

We see a rather sheepish rating about to sink his teeth into a human leg. Sir John puts his hand in front of the lens. Cut to Runcorn Avenue, an ordinary street with houses now turned into flats. The land-rover arrives with the equipment.

Second Interviewer

I'm now standing in Runcorn Avenue. Sir John ... where exactly is the lake?

Sir John

Er, well let's see, that's 18... that's 20 so this must be the one.

Second Interviewer

Er, excuse me...

Sir John

Yes, that's the one all right.

Second Interviewer

But it's an ordinary house.

Sir John

Look, I'm getting pretty irritated with this line of questioning.

Second Interviewer

But it doesn't even look like a lake...

Sir John

Look, your whole approach since this interview started has been to mock the Navy. When I think that it was for the likes of you that I had both my legs blown off...

Second Interviewer

pointing at perfectly healthy legs

Second Interviewer

You haven't had both your legs blown off!

Sir John

I was talking metaphorically you fool. Jenkins - put that down.

Sir John goes to the front door of 22A and rings. Then he looks into the living room through the window. A middle-aged couple are sitting inside. The room is full of water. The man reads the paper and the woman knits. Both wear breathing apparatus. Sir John knocks on the window. The woman looks up.

Sir John

Hello.

Woman

Ooooh. I think it's someone about the damp.

Man

Tell 'em about the bleeding rats, too.

Woman

I'll go

Woman

she swims to window and shouts out

Woman

Yes?

Sir John

Good morning, is this Lake Pahoe?

Woman

Well, I don't know about that, but it's bleeding damp. Are you from the council?

Sir John

No. We are the official British Naval Expedition to this lake. May we come in?

Woman

Hang on.

She submerges and picks up a big sign showing it to the man. The sign reads 'It's not the council, it's a British Naval Expedition to Lake Pahoe or something and can they come in'. The man reads the card. An enormous shark looks over his shoulder appearing from a cupboard. The man sees it and hits it with a newspaper.

Man

Bloody sharks.

Woman

Get in.

He holds up a sign reading 'Tell them to go away'. The woman swims to the window and gives a V-sign to Sir John.

Sir John

Well um... that would appear to be the end of the expedition.

Cut to an interview set.

Interviewer

The Magna Carta - was it a document signed at Runnymede in 1215 by King John pledging independence to the English barons, or was it a piece of chewing gum on a bedspread in Dorset? The latter idea is the brainchild of a man new to the field of historical research. Mr Badger, why - why are you on this programme?

Pull back to show Mr Badger. He wears a flat cap and has a Scots accent.

Badger

Well, I think I can answer this question most successfully in mime.

Badger

mimes incomprehensibly

Interviewer

But why Dorset?

Badger

Well, I have for a long time been suffering from a species of brain injury which I incurred during the rigours of childbirth, and I'd like to conclude by putting my finger up my nose.

Interviewer

Mr Badger, I think you're the silliest person we've ever had on this programme, and so I'm going to ask you to have dinner with me.

CAPTION: 'LATER THE SAME SKETCH'

Cut to them sitting at a restaurant table.

Badger

My wife Maureen ran off with a bottle of Bell's whisky during the Aberdeen versus Raith Rovers match which ended in a goalless draw. Robson particularly, in goal, had a magnificent first half, his fine positional sense preventing the build-up of any severe pressure on the suspect Aberdeen defense. McLoughlan missed an easy chance to clinch the game towards the final whistle but Raith must be well satisfied with their point.

Interviewer

Do please go on. This is the least fascinating conversation I've ever had.

A waiter comes in.

Waiter

Would you like to order sir?

Interviewer

Yes, Mr Badger, what would you like to start with?

Badger

Er, I'll have a whisky to start with.

Waiter

For first course, sir?

Badger

Aye.

Waiter

And for main course, sir?

Badger

I'll have a whisky for main course and I'll follow that with a whisky for pudding.

Waiter

Yes sir, and what would you like with it, sir? A whisky?

Badger

No, a bottle of wine.

Waiter

Fine, sir, he said between clenched teeth knowing full well it was a most unrewarding part.

Interviewer

This is the silliest sketch I've ever been in.

Dear real Princess Margaret, thank you for the eels, full stop. They were absolutely delicious and unmistakably regal, full stop. Sorry to mench but if you've finished with the hairdryer could you pop it in the post? Yours fictionally Biggles, Oh, PS see you at the Saxe-Coburgs' canasta evening.

Cut to mountain climbers, with all the accoutrements: ropes, carabino's, helmets, pitons, hammers, etc. They are roped together, apparently climbing a mountain.

Voice Over

Climbing. The world's loneliest sport, where hardship and philosophy go hand in glove. And here, another British expedition, attempting to be the first man to successfully climb the north face of the Uxbridge Road.

Well they've spent a good night in there last night in preparation for the final assault today. The leader of the expedition is twenty-nine-year-old Bert Tagg - a local headmaster and mother of three.

Cut to Bert crawling along the pavement. The interviewer is crouching down beside him.

Interviewer

Bert

Well, it's a bit gripping is this, Chris.

Interviewer

Such quiet courage is typical of the way these brave chaps shrug off danger. Like it or not, you've got to admire the skill that goes into it.

By the miracle of stop action, they all fall off the road, back down the pavement. Passers-by, also in stop action, walk by normally, ignoring the fall.

Cut to an ordinary kitchen. A Mrs Pinnet type lady with long apron and headscarf is stuffing a chicken with various unlikely objects. The door opens. Sound of rain, wind and storm outside. A liftboatman enters, soaked to the skin. He shuts the door.

First Lifeboatman

taking off his sou'wester and shaking the water off it

First Lifeboatman

Oh it's terrible up on deck.

Mrs Neves

Up on deck?

First Lifeboatman

Yes on deck. It's diabolical weather.

Mrs Neves

What deck, dear?

First Lifeboatman

The deck, The deck of the lifeboat.

Mrs Neves

This isn't a lifeboat, dear. This is 24, Parker Street.

First Lifeboatman

This is the Newhaven Lifeboat.

Mrs Neves

No it's not, dear.

The First Lifeboatman puts on his sou'wester, goes over to the back door and opens it, He peers out. Sound of wind and lashing rain. Cut to the back door at the side of a suburban home, the lifeboatman looking out over the lawns, flowers and windless, rainless calm across to similar neat suburban houses. The noise cuts. The liftboatman withdraws his head from the door. Sound of wind and rain again which cease abruptly as he withdraws his head and shuts the door.

First Lifeboatman

You're right. This isn't a lifeboat at all.

Mrs Neves

No, I wouldn't live here if it was,

First Lifeboatman

Do you mind if I sit down for a minute and collect my wits?

Mrs Neves

No, you do that, I'll make you a nice cup of tea.

First Lifeboatman

Thanks very much.

The door flies open. More sound of wind and rain. Two other rain-soaked lifeboatmen appear.

Second Lifeboatman

Oooh, it's a wild night up top.

Third Lifeboatman

Your turn on deck soon, Charlie.

First Lifeboatman

It's not a lifeboat, Frank.

Third Lifeboatman

What?

Second Lifeboatman

What do you mean?

First Lifeboatman

It's not a lifeboat. It's this lady's house.

The two lifeboatmen look at each other, then turn and open the door. Sound of wind and rain as usual. They peer out. Cut to the back door - the two lifeboatmen are peering out. They shout.

Second and Third Lifeboatmen

Captain! Captain! Ahoy there! Ahoy there! Captain!!

Their voices carry over the following shot or two. Cut to reverse angle of window across the road. A net curtain moves and an eye peers out. We still hear the shouts. Close up on an elderly spinster (Gladys) holding the net curtain discreetly ajar.

Enid

Who's that shouting?

We pull out to reveal a sitting room full of high-powered eavesdropping equipment, i.e. an enormous telescope on wheels with a controller's chair attached to it, several subsidiary telescopes pointing out of the window, radar scanners going round and round, two computers with flashing lights, large and complex tape and video recorders, several TV monitors, oscilloscopes, aerials, etc. All these have been squeezed in amongst the furniture of two retired middle-class old ladies. Enid, a dear old lady with a bun, sits at the control seat of an impressive-looking console, pressing buttons. She also has some knitting.

Gladys

It's a man outside Number 24.

Enid

Try it on the five inch, Gladys.

Gladys

looking at the array of telescopes

Gladys

I can't. I've got that fixed on the Baileys at Number 13. Their new lodger moves in today.

Enid

All fight, hold 13 on the five-inch and transfer the Cartwrights to the digital scanner.

Gladys leaps over to the tape deck, presses levers and switches. Sound of tape reversing. There is a hum and lights flash on and off. A blurred image of a lady in the street comes up on one of the monitors.

Enid

Hold on, Mrs Pettigrew's coming back from the doctor's.

Gladys

All right, bring her up on two. What's the duration reading on the oscillator?

Enid

48.47.

Gladys

Well that's a long time for someone who's just had a routine checkup.

Enid

reading a graph on a computer

Enid

Yes, her pulse rate's 146!

Gladys

Zoom in on the 16mm and hold her, Enid.

Enid

Roger, Gladys.

Gladys

I'll try and get her on the twelve-inch.

Gladys

she dips into the control seat of the huge mobile telescope; we cut to the view through Gladys's telescope - out of focus at first, but then sharper as she zooms in towards the side door of Number 24

Gladys

the curtain is opened a little

Gladys

Thank you, love.

Cut to the interior of Mrs Neves's kitchen once again. It is absolutely full of lifeboatmen. They are all talking happily and drinking cups of tea. We pick up the conversation between two them.

First Lifeboatman

Yes, it's one of those new self-righting models. Newhaven was about the first place in the country to get one.

Second Lifeboatman

What's the displacement on one of them jobs then?

First Lifeboatman

Oh it's about 140-150 per square inch.

Mrs Neves

Who's for fruit cake?

All

Oh yes, please, please.

Mrs Neves

Yes, right, macaroons, that's two dozen fruit cakes, half a dozen macaroons. Right ho. Won't be a jiffy then.

She puts a scarf on, picks up a basket and goes out of the front door. As she opens door, we hear the sound of a storm which carries us into the next shot. Cut to the deck of a lifeboat; rain-lashed, heaving, wind-tossed Mrs Neves struggles against the gale force winds along the deck. She hammers on a hatch in the forward part of the lifeboat.

Mrs Neves

Yoohoo! Mrs Edwards!

The hatch opens and a cosy shop-keeping pepperpot sticks her head out.

Mrs Edwards

Hello.

Mrs Neves

Hello, two dozen fruit cakes and half a dozen macaroons.

Mrs Edwards

Sorry love, no macaroons. How about a nice vanilla sponge?

Mrs Neves

Yes, that'll be lovely.

Mrs Edwards

Right ho.

Mrs Edwards

By the way, do you do lunches?

Mrs Edwards

No, morning coffee and teas only.

Cut to very quick series of stills of storage jars.

CAPTION: 'STORAGE JARS'

Urgent documentary music. Mix through to an impressive documentary set. Zoom in to presenter in a swivel chair. He swings around to face the camera.

Presenter

Good evening and welcome to another edition of 'Storage Jars'. On tonight's programme Mikos Antoniarkis, the Greek rebel leader who seized power in Athens this morning, tells us what he keeps in storage jars.

Cut to a road in front of a heap of smouldering rubble. Dull thuds of mortars. Reporter in short sleeves standing in tight shot. Explosions going off behind him at intervals.

Rodgers

This is La Paz, Bolivia, behind me you can hear the thud of mortars and the high-pitched whine of rockets, as the battle for control of this volatile republic shakes the foundations of this old city.

Rodgers

slowly we pull out during this until we see in front of him a fairly long trestle table set out with range of diffrent-sized storage jar

Rodgers

the explosions continue behind him

Rodgers

Here the largest size is used for rice and for mangoes - a big local crop. Unlike most revolutionary South American states they've an intermediary size in between the 2 lb and 5 lb jars. This gives this poor but proud people a useful jar for apricots, plums and stock cubes. The smallest jar - this little 2oz jar, for sweets, chocolates and even little shallots. No longer used in the West it remains here as an unspoken monument to the days when La Paz knew better times. Ronald Rodgers, 'Storage Jars', La Paz.

Mr Tussaud

Hello, the, er, show so far...well it all started with the organist losing all his clothes as he sat down at the organ, and after this had happened and we had seen the titles of the show, we saw Biggles dictating a letter to his secretary, who thought he was Spanish, and whom he referred to as a harlot and a woman of the night, although she preferred to be called a courtesan. Then we saw some people trying to climb a road in Uxbridge. And then there were some cartoons and then some lifeboatmen came into a woman's sitting room and after a bit the woman went out to buy some cakes on a lifeboat and then a naval officer jumped into the sea. Then we saw a man telling us about storage jars from Bolivia, then there were some more cartoons and a man told us about what happened on the show so far and a great hammer came down and hit him on the head.

A montage of photographs. The cutting from photo to photo is pretty fast. Greek music is heard. Starting with: a close up of Mousebender, who is respectable and wears smart casual clothes; various photos of Mousebender walking along the pavement, again very artily shot from show-off angles; Mousebender pausing outside a shop; Mousebender looking up at the shop; Edwardian-style shop with large sign above it reading 'Ye Olde Cheese Emporium'; another sign below the first reading 'Henry Wensleydale, Purveyor of Fine Cheese to the Gentry and the Poverty Stricken Too'; another sign below this reading 'Licensed for Public Dancing'; close up of Mousebender looking pleased; shot of Mousebender entering the shop. Music cuts dead. Cut to interior of the cheese shop. Greek music playing as Mousebender enters. Two men dressed as city gents are Greek dancing in the corner to the music of a bouzouki. The shop itself is large and redolent of the charm and languidity of a bygone age. There is actually no cheese to be seen either on or behind the counter but this is not obvious. Mousebender approaches the counter and rings a small handbell. Wensleydale appears.

Wensleydale

Good morning, sir.

Mousebender

Good Morning. I was sitting in the public library on Thurmon Street just now, skimming through 'Rogue Herries' by Horace Walpole, when suddenly I came over all peckish.

Wensleydale

Peckish, sir?

Yes certainly, sir. What would you like?

Mousebender

Well, how about a little Red Leicester.

Wensleydale

I'm, afraid we're fresh out of Red Leicester, sir.

Mousebender

Oh, never mind. How are you on Tilsit?

Wensleydale

Never at the end of the week, sir. Always get it fresh first thing on Monday.

Mousebender

Tish tish. No matter. Well, four ounces of Caerphilly, then, if you please, stout yeoman.

Wensleydale

Ah well, it's been on order for two weeks, sir, I was expecting it this morning.

Mousebender

Yes, it's not my day, is it? Er, Bel Paese?

Mousebender

Oh, I like it runny.

Wensleydale

Well as a matter of fact it's

I don't care how excrementally runny it is. Hand it over with all speed.

Wensleydale

Fair enough.

Mousebender

Wensleydale.

Wensleydale

Yes, sir?

pause

Mousebender

Well let's keep it simple, how about Cheddar?

Wensleydale

Well, I'm afraid we don't get much call for it around these parts.

Mousebender

Not call for it? It's the single most popular cheese in the world!

Wensleydale

Not round these parts, sir.

Mousebender

And pray what is the most popular cheese round these parts?

Wensleydale

Ilchester, sir.

Mousebender

I see.

Wensleydale

Yes, sir. It's quite staggeringly popular in the manor, squire.

Mousebender

Is it.

Wensleydale

Yes sir, it's our number-one seller.

Wensleydale

Yes sir.

Mousebender

Ilchester, eh?

Wensleydale

Right.

Mousebender

OK, I'm game. Have you got any, he asked, expecting the answer no?

Wensleydale

I'll have a look, sir...nnnnnnooooooooo.

Mousebender

It's not much of a cheese shop really, is it?

Wensleydale

Finest in the district, sir.

Mousebender

And what leads you to that conclusion?

Wensleydale

Well, it's so clean.

Mousebender

Well, it's certainly uncontaminated by cheese.

Wensleydale

You haven't asked me about Limberger, sir.

Mousebender

Is it worth it?

Wensleydale

Could be.

Mousebender

OK, have you...

Mousebender

will you shut that bloody dancing up!

Mousebender

the music stops

Wensleydale

to dancers

Wensleydale

Told you so.

Mousebender

Have you got any Limberger?

Mousebender

No, that figures. It was pretty predictable, really. It was an act of purest optimism to pose the question in the first place. Tell me something, do you have any cheese at all?

Mousebender

Now I'm going to ask you that question once more, and if you say 'no' I'm going to shoot you through the head. Now, do you have any cheese at all?

Mousebender

shoots him

Mousebender

What a senseless waste of human life.

Mousebender puts a cowboy hat on his head. Cut to stock shot of man on horse riding into the sunset. Music swells dramatically.

one of the first of the Cheese Westerns to be later followed by 'Gunfight at Gruyère Corral', 'Ilchester 73', and 'The Cheese Who Shot Liberty Valence'. While I'm on the subject of Westerns, I want to take a closer look at one of my favourite film directors, Sam Peckinpah, the expatriate from Fresno, California.

SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'AND STOP SNIFFING'

SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'WILL YOU STOP SNIFFING'

Philip Jenkinson

In his latest film Peckinpah has moved into the calmer and more lyrical waters of Julian Slade's, 'Salad Days'.

Lyrical scene of boys in white flannels and girls in pretty dresses frolicking on a lawn to the accompaniment of a piano played by one of the boys.

SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'SALAD DAYS (1971) DIRECTOR SAM PECKINPAH'

The boys and girls cease frolicking and singing. Lionel enters holding a tennis racket.

Lionel

Hello everybody.

All

Hello Lionel.

Lionel

I say what a simply super day.

All

Gosh yes.

Woman

It's so, you know, sunny.

Lionel

Yes isn't it? I say anyone for tennis?

Julian

Oh super!

Charles

What fun.

Julian

I say, Lionel, catch.

He throws the tennis ball to Lionel. It hits Lionel on the head. Lionel claps one hand to his forehead. He roars in pain as blood seeps through his fingers.

Lionel

Oh gosh.

He tosses his racket out of frame and we hear a hideous scream. The camera pans to pick up a pretty girl in summer frock with the handle of the racket embedded in her stomach. Blood is pouring out down her dress.

Woman

Oh crikey.

Spitting blood out of her mouth she collapses onto the floor clutching at Charles's arm. The arm comes off. Buckets of blood burst out of the shoulder drenching the girl and anyone else in the area. He staggers backwards against the piano. The piano lid drops, severing the pianist's hands. The pianist screams. He stands, blood spurting from his hands over piano music. The piano collapses in slow motion, shot from several angles simultaneously as per 'Zabriskie Point'. Intercut terrified faces of girls screaming in slow motion. The piano eventually crushes them to death; an enormous pool of blood immediately swells up from beneath piano where the girls are. We see Julian stagger across the frame with the piano keyboard through his stomach. As he turns the end of the keyboard knocks off the head of a terrified girl who is sitting on the grass nearby. A volcanic quantity of blood geysers upwards. Pull out and upward from this scene as the music starts again. Cut back to Philip Jenkinson.

Philip Jenkinson

Pretty strong meat there from

The green lush Devon countryside. Theme music. The camera is tracking along a hedgerow beside the road. We see a head whizzing along, sometimes just above the hedgerow and sometimes bobbing out of sight, accasionally for long periods.

SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'THE CYCLING TOUR'

Mr. Pither, the cyclist, bobs up and down a few more times, then disappears from sight. There is a crash and clang of a bicycle in collision, mixed with the scream of a frightened hen, and stifled shout of alarm. We are still in long shot and see nothing. The music stops abruptly on the crash.

Pither

August 18th. Fell off near Bovey Tracey. The pump caught in my trouser leg.

Cut to interior of a transport cafe. A rather surly proprietor with fag in mouth is operating an Espresso coffee machine. Pither, a fussy bespectacled little man, in sweater, trousers, is leaning over the counter, talking chattily.

Pither

The pump caught in my trouser leg, and my sandwiches were badly crushed.

Proprietor

35p please.

He goes back to working the machine.

Pither

These sandwiches, however, were an excellent substitute.

Enormous lorry driver comes up to counter.

Driver

Give us ten woods, Barney.

the lorry driver looks at him without interest

Pither

the driver goes off with his cigarettes

Pither

Ah! I have only a fifty. Do you have change?

Proprietor

Well I'll have a look, but I may have to go to the bank.

Pither

I'm most awfully sorry.

Pither

Oh, what a stroke of luck. Well, all the very best.

Pither

Pither proffers his hand, the proprietor ignores it

Pither

And thank you again for the excellent banana and cheese delicacy.

He exits busily. The proprietor looks after him. Cut to hedgerows. Theme music. Pither's head bobbing up and down. At the same point in the music it disappears and there is a crash mingled with grunting of pig.

Pither

August 23rd. Fell off near Budleigh Salterton.

Pither

I think in future I shall lash them to the handlebars with adhesive tape...this should obviate a recurrence of the same problem...well I can't stop here all day...I'm on a cycling tour of North Cornwall. Must be off.

Cut to hedgerows again. Pither's head bowling along. Theme music. He dips out of sight. Crash and a cow moos.

Pither

August 26th. Fell off near Ottery St Mary. The pump caught in my trouser leg. Decided to wear short trousers from now on.

Another brief shot of the animated monster peeking over a hedgerow. Cut to another hedgerow. Pither's head bowling along. Short burst of music. Crash.

Pither

Fell off near Tiverton. Perhaps a shorter pump is the answer.

Another monster peeps briefly. Cut to a tiny village high street, deserted save for an old lady. Pither cycles into shot. He is in shorts, but still has his bicycle clips on. He approaches the old lady.

Pither

Excuse me, madam, I wonder if you could tell me of a good bicycle shop in this village, where I could find either a means of adapting my present pump, or failing that, purchase a replacement?

Old lady

There's only one shop here.

She points with a shaking finger. Camera pans very slightly to one side to reveal a shop with a huge four-foot-high sign: 'Bicycle Pump Centre - Specialists In Shorter Bicycle Pumps'. Another sign: 'Short Pumps Available Here'. Another sign: 'We Shorten Pumps While-U-Wait'. The camera shows the shop only for a couple of seconds and pans back to the old lady and Pither.

Pither

What a stroke of luck. Now perhaps cycling will become less precarious.

Cut to interior of doctor's surgery. There is a knock on the door.

.

Doctor

Yes? (a nurse puts her head round the door)

Nurse

A Mr Pither to see you, doctor. His bicycle pump got caught in his sock.

Doctor

Oh, thank you nurse, show him in please.

Nurse

This way, please.

The nurse exits, Pither enters in shorts and sweater.

Doctor

Morning.

Pither

Oh, a very good morning to you too, Doctor

Doctor

Ah, I understand you had an accident?

Pither

Yes, my pump got...

Doctor

...caught in your sock.

Pither

Absolutely. Yes. My fruit cake was damaged on one side.

Doctor

Well...

Pither

It's got grit all over it.

Doctor

Well now, are you in pain?

Pither

Oh, heavens no.

Doctor

Ah well, where were you hurt?

Pither

Oh, fortunately, I escaped without injury.

Doctor

Well what is the trouble?

Pither

Please, could you tell me the way to Iddesleigh?

Doctor

I'm a doctor, you know.

Pither

Oh yes, absolutely. Normally I would have asked a policeman or a minister of the Church, but finding no one available, I thought it better to consult a man with some professional qualifications, rather than rely on the possibly confused testimony of a passer-by.

Doctor

Oh alright.

Doctor

he scribbles something on a piece of paper and hands it to Pither

Doctor

Take this to a chemist.

Pither

Thank you.

Cut to exterior of a chemist's shop. A chemist comes out holding the paper and points up the street. Pither thanks him and mounts his bike. Cut to the hedgerows again. Pither's head. Theme music reaches the point where Pither normally falls off, his head disappears, the music cuts off. There is no crash. Suddenly Pither's head reappears further on and the music starts up again.

Pither

September 2nd. Did not fall off outside Iddesley.

Cut to a small market town. A line of cars. Pither's head just above roofs of cars. Theme music. He suddenly disappears, the music stops and there is a crash.

Pither

Fell off in Tavistock.

Cut to a discreet corner of a Watney's pub. Soft music. A middle-aged businessman and a sexy secretary who obviously want to be alone are sitting huddled over a table. At the next table is Pither, with half-pint in front of him.

Pither

My foot caught in my trouser leg and that's how the bottle broke.

Girl

Tell her today, you could ring her.

Man

I can't. I can't.

Pither

I said you'd never guess.

Man

Sixteen years we've been together. I can't just ring her up.

Girl

Well, if you can't do it now, you never will.

Pither

tapping the man on the leg

Pither

Do you like Tizer?

Man

to Pither

Man

What? No. No.

Girl

Do you want me or not, James? It's your decision.

Pither

I suppose it is still available in this area, is it?

Girl

Do you want me or not, James?

Man

What?

Pither

Tizer.

Girl

Yes or no.

Pither

Is it still available in this area?

Man

I don't know.

Girl

I see, in that case it's goodbye for ever, James.

Man

No! I mean yes!

Pither

Oh it is, is it?

Man

No.

Girl

Oh! You never could make up your mind.

Man

I can.... I have....

Girl

taking off ring

Girl

Goodbye James.

She runs out sobbing.

Man

No wait, Lucille!

Pither

Does your lovely daughter like Tizer? Eh?

Man

Lucille!

Pither

Wouldn't mind buying her a bottle of Tizer.... if it's available in this area, that is.

Man

turning on Pither

Man

Would you like me to show you the door?

Pither

Oh, that's extremely kind of you, but I saw it on the way in.

Man

You stupid, interfering little rat.

Pither

Oh! The very words of the garage mechanic in Bude!

The man picks Pither up by the scruff of the neck and the seat of his pants. He carries him bodily towards the door.

Pither

I had just fallen off my bicycle, this is most kind of you, and my lemon curd tartlet had...

Man

Damn your lemon curd tartlet!

Pither is thrown out. He picks himself up and sees girl outside sobbing.

Pither

Just had a chat with your dad.

Girl bursts into further tears. Whistling cheerfully, Pither gets on his bicycle and, happier than he has been for a long time, he cycles off down the road and round a corner. Sounds of car-tyre screech and crash of Pither going straight into a car. Cut to interior of car speeding along highway. Pither is sitting in the back seat with his bicycle. The driver, Mr Gulliver, talks with a professional precision.

Pither

My rubber instep caught on the rear mudguard stanchion and...

Gulliver

Really? And what happened to the corned beef rolls?

Pither

The corned beef rolls squashed out of all...here, how did you know about the corned beef rolls?

Gulliver

I noticed them - or what remained of them - in the road. I noticed also that the lemon curd tart had sustained some superficial damage.

Pither

That's right. The curd had become...

Gulliver

Detached from the pastry base.

Pither

with some surprise

Pither

Absolutely right, yes.

Gulliver

Otherwise the contents of the sandwich box were relatively unharmed, although I detected small particles of bitumen in the chocolate kup kakes.

Pither

But they were wrapped in foil!

Gulliver

Not the hard chocolate top, I'm afraid.

Pither

Oh, that's the bit I like.

Gulliver

The sausage roll, the crisps and ginger bisquit were unscathed.

Pither

How do you know so much about cycling?

Gulliver

Well, I'm making a special study of accidents involving food.

Pither

Really?

Gulliver

Yes, do you know that in our laboratories, we have developed a cheese sandwich that can withstand an impact of 4,000 pounds per square inch?

Pither

Good heavens!

Gulliver

Amazing, isn't it? We have also developed a tomato which can eject itself when an accident is imminent.

Pither

Even if it's inside an egg and tomato roll?

Gulliver

Anywhere! Even if it's in your stomach, and it senses an accident it will come up your throat and out of the window. Do you realise what this means?

Pither

Safer food?

Gulliver

Exactly! No longer will food be squashed, crushed and damaged, by the ignorance and stupidity of the driver!

Gulliver

becoming slightly messianic

Gulliver

Whole picnics will be built to withstand the most enormous forces! Snacks will be safer than ever! An simple pot of salad dressing, treated in our laboratories, has been subjected to the impact of a 4,000 pound steam hammer every day for the last sixteen years and has it broken?

Pither

Er....well...

Gulliver

Yes, of course it has...but there are other ideas - the safety straps for sardines for instance.

A tomato leaps up out of the glove compartment and hovers, then it ejects itself out of the car window

Pither

Here, that tomato just ejected itself.

Gulliver

Really?

Gulliver

embracing Pither excitedly

Gulliver

the car crashes

Fade out. Fade up on country road. Pither is cycling along with Gulliver on the back of the bicycle. Gulliver has his head bandaged and his arm in a sling. Occasionally strains of Clodagh Rogers hit 'Jack in a box' float towards us as Gulliver moves rhythmically.

Pither

voice over

Pither

What a strange turn this cycling tour has taken. Mr Gulliver appears to have lost his memory and far from being interested in safer food is now convinced that he is Clodagh Rogers, the young girl singer. I am taking him for medical attention.

Cut to Pither and Gulliver cycling into hospital. A sign says 'North Cornwall District Hospital'. Cut to nurse receptionist at a counter with a glass window which lifts up and down. Pither appears.

Pither

Is this the Casualty Department?

Nurse

Yes, that's right.

Noise of splintering wood and crash out of vision. Pither and the nurse look up. A bench has collapsed in the middle and three patients sitting on it have slid into a heap in the middle. A nurse is on her way to assist. Cut back to Pither and nurse.

Nurse

And what can I do for you?

The window comes down on her fingers, she winces sharply in pain. She pushes it up again.

Pither

I am at present on a cycling tour of the North Cornwall area taking in Bude and...

Nurse

Could I have your name please?

Pither

Ah, my name is Pither.

Nurse

What?

Pither

P-I-T-H-E-R ...as in Brotherhood, but with PI instead of the BRO and no HOOD.

Nurse

I see...

Pither

I had just visited Taunton...

Terrific crash. Cut to trolley on its side, and a bandaged patient under a mound of hospital instruments and a nurse standing looking down.

Nurse

Sh!

Pither

...and was cycling north towards...

Nurse

Yes, where were you injured?

Pither

Just where the A397 Ilfracombe road meets the...

Nurse

On your

Nurse

body

Nurse

...

Pither

Ah no... it's not I who was injured, it's my friend.

Nurse scowls, crumples up paper, and throws it away. The piece of paper hits a smallish cabinet of glass which topples forward and smashes.

Nurse

Tut... Name?

Pither

Pither.

Nurse

No, no, no, no. Your friend's name.

Pither

Oh, Clodagh Rogers...

Nurse

Clodagh Rogers!?

Pither

Well only since about 4:30....

Nurse

Yes. I think you'd better talk to Doctor Wu... Doctor!

Cut to a doctor unloading a crate balanced on top of a medicine. He whips round knocking off the crate.

Doctor

What? Damn!

Cut to patient in a wheelchair being pushed. The wheelchair completely collapses and the nurse is left holding the handles. Quick cut to the nurse as window comes down on her fingers again.

Nurse

Aaaaaagh!

Doctor comes across to pither, limping slightly, in some pain.

Doctor

Now, what's the trouble?

Pither

I am on a cycling tour of...

Nurse

He

Nurse

thinks

Nurse

he's had an accident.

Pither

I have friend who, as a result of his injuries thinks he is Clodagh Rogers.

Doctor

He what?

Pither

Well, what happened was...

A nurse carrying a tray walks past the doctor, making for the entrance doors. As she reaches them they swing open to admit Gulliver, with his head bandaged and his arm in a sling. He collides with the nurse; she drops her tray. He graps Pither and they exit rapidly, stepping on the doctor's foot in the process. The doctor yells, grabs his foot, and as he does so the reception window slamms down, trapping his hand. He howls in pain. Cut to a camp fire at midnight in a forest clearing. By the light of the fire, Pither is writing up his diary.

Pither

voice over

Pither

Gulliver enters the scene; his head is still bandaged

Pither

Oh hello!

Gulliver

We cannot stay here. We must leave immediately. There is a ship in Marseilles.

Pither

I did enjoy your song for Europe, Clodagh.

Gulliver

I have seen an agent in the town. My life is in danger.

Pither

Danger, Clodagh?

Gulliver

Stalin has always hated me.

Pither

No one hates you, Clodagh.

Gulliver

I will not let myself fall into the hands of these scum.

Pither

I think you should go and have a little lie down, my dear. There is a busy day tomorrow of concerts and promotional tours.

Gulliver

I. One of the founders of the greatest nation on earth. I! Whom Lenin has called his greatest friend.

From the darkness we hear French voices.

M. Brun

Taisez-vous. Taisez-vous.

Pither

Oh dear.

Gulliver

I! Who have worked all my life that my people should live.

A pair of middle class French people in pyjamas appear.

M. Brun

Taisez-vous. Qu'est-ce que le bruit? C'est impossible!

Pither

Er... my name is Pither.

M. Brun

Oh... you are English?

Pither

Er yes, that's right. I'm on a cycling tour of North Cornwall, taking in Bude...

Gulliver

I will not be defeated. I will return to my country to fight against this new tyranny!

Pither

This is Clodagh Rogers, the Irish-born girl singer.

Mme. Brun

Mais oui - c'est Clodagh Rogers - 'Jack-in-a-box'!

Mme. Brun

sings

Mme. Brun

calls

Mme. Brun

Genevieve! Gerard! C'est Clodagh Rogers la fameuse chanteuse Anglaise.

Two teenagers in pyjamas and carrying autograph books appear and rush towards Gulliver.

Gulliver

I will never surrender! I will never surrender!...

Genevieve

Excusez-moi Madame Clodagh. Ecrivez-vous votre nom dans mon livre des hommes célèbrites, s'il vous plait. Là, au-dessous de Denis Compton.

Genevieve

Gulliver signs and hands the book back.

Genevieve

Maman! Ce n'est pas la belle Clodagh.

Mme. Brun

Quoi?

Genevieve

C'est Trotsky le révolutionaire.

M. Brun

Trotsky!

Mme. Brun

Mais Trotsky ne chante pas.

M. Brun

Il chante un peu.

Mme. Brun

Mais pas professionalement. Qu'il pense de Lenin.

M. Brun

Ah! Lenin!! Quel chanteur: 'If I ruled the world'.

A brief film clip of Lenin, apparently singing the next line of the song.

Gulliver

Lenin. My friend. I come.

He dashes off into the forest possessed.

Pither

Oh excuse her, she's not very well recently, pressure of work, laryngitis, you know...

He gets on his bike and pedals off hurriedly after Gulliver into the forest.

M. Brun

still reminiscing

M. Brun

Et aussi Monsieur Kerensky avec le 'Little White Bull', eh?

Mme. Brun

Formidable.

Cut to a few quick shots of Gulliver dashing through the trees and then of Pither making much slower progress due to his bike. Cut to a shot of a French couple snogging in car.

Gulliver

Lenin! I come! Lenin!

Frenchman

Je t'aime.

French Girl

seeing Gulliver

French Girl

Maurice! Regardez! C'est la chanteuse anglaise Clodagh Rogers.

Frenchman

Ah mais oui!

Frenchman

sings

Frenchman

he switches on car radio and the song is heard throughout the forest

Cut to Russian street. Pither cycles along with Gulliver looking like Trotsky on the back.

Pither

voice over

Pither

After several days I succeeded in tracking down my friend Mr Gulliver on the outskirts of Smolensk.

Cut to military man. He has a large map of Europe and Russia and a stick with which he raps at the places.

Military Man

Smolensk. 200 miles east of Minsk. 200 north of Kursk. 1500 miles west of Omsk.

Cut back to Pither and Gulliver.

Pither

Thank you.

They've stopped by a signpost that says 'Smolensk town centre 1/2, Tavistock 1612 miles'.

Pither

Anyway, as we were so far from home, and as Mr Gulliver, still believing himself to be Trotsky, was very tired from haranguing the masses all the way from Monte Carlo,

Cut to military man who thumps the map again.

Military Man

Monte Carlo. 100 miles south of Turin. 100 east of Pisa. 500 miles west of Bilbao.

Cut back to Pither.

Pither

Thank you. I decided to check...

Pither

I decided to check...

Pither

No, sorry you go on.

Pither

I decided to check him into a hotel while I visited the British Embassy to ask for help in returning to Cornwall.

They leave the bicycle on the kerb and enter a door with the sign 'YMACA.' over it.

Pither

And so we registered at the Smolensk Young Men's Anti-Christian Association.

Cut to military man.

Military Man

YMACA. Corner of Anti-Semitic Street and Pogrom Square.

Pither

by now standing at the reception desk with Gulliver

Pither

to departing desk clerk

Pither

No, not you. A single room for my friend please.

Desk Clerk

Yes, sir. Bugged or unbugged?

Gulliver

as Trotsky

Gulliver

I think I'd be happier with a bugged one.

Desk Clerk

Right, one bugged with bath.

Pither

Well, just have a nice lie down, and I'll go to the Embassy.

He goes. Gulliver signs hotel register.

Desk Clerk

looking at the book

Desk Clerk

Trotsky! My lack of God, it's Trotsky!

A couple of people race in excitedly.

Gulliver

Comrades. Socialism is not a...

Mix through to the British Consulate. Pither cycles up, parks his bike and goes in. Imperial music. Mix through to interior. A picture of the queen is dimly visible on the back wall. A Chinaman approaches. He is dressed in traditional Mandarin's robe and cap.

Pither

Excuse me. Is this the British Consulate?

Chinaman

Yes yes... si si...that is correctment. Yes... Piccadilly Circus, mini-skirt and Joe Lyons.

Pither

I wish to see the consul, please.

Chinaman

Yes, yes, speakee speakee... me Blitish consul.

Pither

Pither

Oh, successor.

Chinaman

I'm his successor, Mr Atkinson.

Pither

Oh.

Chinaman

Pither

Well.... A drink would be very nice.

The Chinaman claps his hands and another runs in and bows obsequiously.

Chinaman

Mr. Livingstone. Go and get sake.

Livingstone

Yes, Boss.

Livingstone

goes

Chinaman

How is Tonblidge Wells? How I long to see again walls of famous Shakespeare-style theatre in Stlatford-on-Avon.

Pither

Oh well, I'm a West Country man myself, Mr. Atkinson.

Chinaman

Pither

Several Mao-suited Chinese people rush in waving the Red Book and shouting 'bingo'. The Chinaman remonstrates with Livingstone and eventually stops them.

Chinaman

Hsai! Solly. Our boys got velly excited.

Chinaman

the Maoists exit

Livingstone

Bingo.

Chinaman

Chinaman

Livingstone

Housey! Housey!

Maoists

rushing back in

Maoists

Cut to stock film of large Chinese crowds.

Chinese Hordes

Housey! Housey! Housey housey!

Cut back to Consulate. The Chinaman is shouting out of window.

Chinaman

Hi skwwati niyhi, keo t'sin feh t'sdung, hih watai bingo cards!

Chinaman

Livingstone

Nihi watai bingo cards?

Pither

Well, I was hoping that you could help me and my friend to get back to England as...you see we're on a cycling tour of North Cornwall...

All

Bingo, bingo, bingo...

The Chinaman ushers Pither out. Brief film of rioting Chinese.

Chinese Hordes

Bingo! Bingo! Bingo! Bingo!

Cut to hotel lobby.

Pither

Is Mr Trotsky in his room, please?

Desk Clerk

No. He has gone to Moscow.

Cut to military man.

Military Man

Moscow. 1500 miles south of...

Cut bach to lobby.

Desk Clerk

Shut up!

Pither

Moscow!

He is surrounded by three secret policemen dressed in identical suits, dark glasses and pork pie hats.

Grip

Come with us, please.

Pither

Oh, who are you?

Bag

Well we're not secret police anyway.

Wallet

That's for sure.

Grip

If anything we are ordinary Soviet systems with no particular interest in politics.

Bag

None at all. Come with us.

Pither

Oh, where are you taking me?

The secret police all move away to confer.

Wallet

What do we tell him?

Grip

Don't tell him any secrets.

Bag

Agreed.

Grip

Tell him anything except that we are taking him to Moscow where Trotsky is reunited with the Central Committee.

They return to Pither.

Wallet

We're taking you to a clambake.

Pither

Oh a clambake! I've never been to one of those.

Grip

Right, let's go.

Bag

Who's giving the orders round here?

Grip

I am. I'm senior to you.

Bag

No, you're not. You're a greengrocer, I'm an insurance salesman.

Grip

Greengrocers are senior to insurance salesmen.

Wallet

Cool it. I'm an ice-cream salesmen and I am senior to both of you.

Bag

You're an ice-cream salesman? I thought you were a vetenarian.

Wallet

I got promoted. Let's go.

Bag

Taxi!

A girl enters dressed as a New York cabbie.

Taxi

Yes.

Bag

Drive us to Moscow.

Taxi

I have no a cab.

Wallet

Why not?

Taxi

I'm in the Secret Police.

Taxi

they all snap into salute

Cut to stock film of train wheels in the night. The siren sounds. Superimposed names zoom into camera, as in a musical: Petrograd, Ottograd, Lewgrad, Lesliegrad, Etceteragrad, Dukhovskoknabilebskohatsk, Moscva. Cut to the stage of a big Russian hall. A banner across the top of the stage reads 'Russian 42nd International Clambake'. At the back of the stage sits Pither with his bicycle. At one side of the stage, at an impressive table on a dais, are some very important Russian persons including generals. One of the generals addresses the audience.

General

General

...Dostoievye useye tovarich trotsky borodina

General

etc.

SUBTITLE: 'THIS IS THE MAN WHO BROUGHT OUR BELOVED TROTSKY BACK TO US'

General

Beluntanks dretsky mihai ovna isky Mr Reg Pither.

SUBTITLE: 'FIRST MAY I PRESENT MR PITHER FROM WEST OF ENGLAND'

Pandemonium lasting for about ten seconds.

General

Shi muska di scensand dravenka oblomov Engleska Solzhenitzhin.

SUBTITLE: 'FORGIVE ME IF I CONTINUE IN ENGLISH IN ORDER TO SAVE TIME'

General

And now, Comrades, the greatest moment of the day, the moment when I ask you to welcome the return of one of Russia's greatest heroes, creator of the Red Army, Lenin's greatest friend, Lev Davidovich Trotsky!

Gulliver appears looking as much like Trotsky as possible. He wears a uniform and has a beard and glasses. Pandemonium breaks out. He eventually quietens them by raising his hands for silence.

Gulliver

Comrades. Bolsheviks. Friends of the Revolution. I have returned.

Gulliver

renewed cheering

Gulliver

his movements are becoming a little camp and slinky

Gulliver

sings

Gulliver

a certain amount of confusion is spreading among the audience and particulary the general on the podium

Gulliver

I want an old-fashioned house with an old-fashioned fence, and an old-fashioned millionaire.

From now on Gulliver continues exactly as Eartha Kitt. He has aquired a fur stole which he manipulates slinkily. The confusion is complete on the stage.

Pither

voice over

Pither

Our friend Mr Gulliver was clearly undergoing another change of personality.

A senior general appears beside Pither with two guards.

General

So! You have duped us. You shall pay for this. Guards, seize him.

The guards seize the startled Pither and drag him away. The senior general strides back across the stage avoiding Gulliver, towards the general who addressed the audience.

General

Shall I seize him too?

Senior General

No, I think we'll have to keep him, he's going down well.

General

He's more fun than he used to be.

Senior General

He's loosened up a lot. This is an old Lenin number.

Cut to Pither sitting in a cell.

Pither

two Russian guards throw the cell door open

Pither

they grab him and march him out of cell

Cut to exterior of a door leading out into prison yard. The door is thrown open and Pither is marched over and stood against a blank wall. There are lots of small holes in the wall.

Pither

What a pleasant exercise yard. How friendly they were all being.

Officer

Cigarettes?

Pither

Oh, no thank you I don't smoke.

Pither facing a line of uniformed men with guns, obviously a firing squad.

Pither

cut to Pither against the wall looking behind him

Pither

I looked around but could not see the target.

Officer

Blindfold?

Pither

very cheerful

Pither

No thank you, no.

Officer

stepping clear

Officer

the firing squad snaps to attention

Officer

they raise their rifles

Officer

Verschnitzen.

Drum roll. The firing squad takes aim. A messenger runs frantically up.

Messenger

Nyet! Nyet! Nyet!

Messenger

he hands the officer a paper

Officer

A telegram?

Officer

examines it

Officer

The squad raise their rifles

Pither

Now I was really for it.

Cut to shot of officer with his hand raised. The same as before, only without Pither in shot. Drum rolls again. He brings his sword down. Volley of shots from the firing squad. The officer is looking in Pither's direction. Long pause.

Officer

to soldiers

Officer

How could you miss?

Soldier

He moved.

Officer

Shut up! Go and practise.

Officer

to Pither

Officer

I'm so sorry. Do you mind waiting in your cell?

Pither is flung back in his cell by the guards, and the door slammed.

Pither

What a stroke of luck. My Crunchie was totally intact. I settled down to a quick intermeal snack...

But he is bundled out again. Pause. Shots. He si bundled in. The officer appears at door.

Officer

Next time. Definitely!

Officer

to aide

Officer

Now then, how many of them have been injured? Oh God...

Pither

As I lay dwon to the sound of the Russian gentlemen practising their shooting, I realised I was in a bit of a pickle. My heart sank as I realised I should never see the Okehampton by-pass again...

Mix to Pither's sleeping face, waking up, shaking himself in disbelief at finding himself in a beautiful garden, with the sun shining, the birds singing. He is in a deckchair, and his mother, having poured him a jug of iced fruit juice, is gently nudging Pither to wake him.

Mother

Come on, dear. Wake up dear.

Pither

Mother!

Mother

Come on dear.

Pither

So, it was all a dream.

Mother

No dear,

Mother

this

Mother

is the dream, you're still in the cell.

Mix to Pither waking up in the cell. The officer enters carrying a rifle.

Officer

OK, we're going to have another try. I think we've got it now. My boys have been looking down the wrong bit, you see.

Pither

Oh no, look, you've got to look down the bit there.

Officer

Oh I thought you had to look down that bit.

Pither

No, no, you've got to look down that bit, or you won't hit anything.

Officer

Alright, we'll give it a whirl. Guards, seize him.

Officer

they take him out

Officer

as he leaves

Officer

Listen. You've got to look down this bit.

As they leave, we can see on the wall of the cell a poster, saying: 'Saturday Night at the Moscow Praesidium, starring Eartha Kitt, with Burgess and Maclean. "A Song a Dance and a Piece of Treachery". Marshal Bulganin and "Charlie", Peter Cook, Dudley Moore, Leningrad has never laughed so much.'

Mix through to stock film of the Kremlin. Dubber over laughter and applause. A cheerful band sing. Mix through to stage where someone dressed as Marshall Bulganin, is standing with a little real ventriloquist's dummy. He gets up, takes his bow and walks off as the curtain swings down. Lots of applause and atmosphere. Terrible Russian compère comes on smiling and applauding.

Compère

Osledi Osledi.

He tells a quick joke in Russian, and roars with laughter. Laughter from audience. He holds up his hands and then becomes very sincere, saying obviously deeply moving, wonderful things about the next guest, whom he finally introduces.

Compère

Eartha Kitt!

Gulliver comes on-stage in the full Eartha Kitt rig - white fur stole, slit skirt and jewellery. He mimes to the voice of Edward Heath.

Heath's Voice

Trade Union leaders - I would say this - we've done our part. Now, on behalf of the community, we have a right to expect you, the Trade Union leaders, to do yours.

Heath's Voice

etc.

Unrest in the audience as they recognize him. They start shouting 'sing "Old-Fashioned Girl"' and throwing vegetables. Slow motion shot of a tomato hitting Gulliver. He is seen to be holding a turnip.

Gulliver

That turnip's certainly not safe.

Gulliver

Gulliver

Oh no! Mr Pither! Mr Pither!

He runs off-stage, pursued by the guards. Cut to the stage-door of the hall. A sign on the door says 'Next week Clodagh Rogers'. Gulliver out, and then through the streets, hotly pursued by soldiers and secret service men, firing after him.

Gulliver

Gulliver

Mr Pither! Mr Pither!

He is seen running through a dockyard. Finally he stops by a high stone wall.

Gulliver

Mr Pither!

Pither's Voice

Here!

Gulliver looks round and then rapidly climbs up and over the wall. He drops down to find Pither standing on the other side.

Pither

Gulliver.

Gulliver

Pither! What a stroke of luck.

Pither

Well yes and no.

He indicates with his head. Cut to show that both of them are standing in front of a firing squad. The officer is heard as before. The squard runs towards them with fixed bayonets.

CAPTION: 'SCENE MISSING'

Cut to Cornish country lane. A road sign says 'Tavistock 12 miles'. Pither stands beneath with Gulliver and his bicycle.

Pither

Phew, what an amazing escape. Well goodbye, Reginald.

Gulliver

Goodbye, Mr Pither, and good luck with the tour!

They shake hands. Gulliver strides off. Pither mounts his bike and rides off into the sunset. Music swells. Roll credits. Cut to a field with hedgerow behind. The first animated monster peeks over the hedge.

First Monster

Hey, I think he's finally gone!

Second monster appears.

Second Monster

Ooh yes!

They hop over the fence into the field.

First Monster

Ready, Maurice?

Second Monster

Right-ho, Kevin. Let's go.

First Monster

All right, maestro, hit it!

We hear Clodagh Rogers singing 'Jack in a Box'. The two monsters jump up and down enthusiastically if not gracefully. Fade out.

Fade up on two pilots in the cockpit of an aeroplane. A stewardess is there too. After a moment or two the first pilot makes an announcement.

First Pilot

This is Captain MacPherson welcoming you aboard East Scottish Airways. You'll have had your tea. Our destination is Glasgow. There is no need to panic.

The door of the cockpit opens and Mr Badger comes in.

Badger

There's a bomb on board this plane, and I'll tell you where it is for a thousand pounds.

Second Pilot

I don't believe you.

Badger

If you don't tell me where the bomb is... if I don't give you the money... Unless you give me the bomb...

Stewardess

The money.

Badger

The money, thank you, pretty lady... the bomb will explode killing everybody.

Second Pilot

Including you.

Badger

I'll tell you where it is for a pound.

Second Pilot

Here's a pound.

Badger

I don't want Scottish money. They've got the numbers. It can be traced.

Second Pilot

One English pound. Now where's the bomb?

Badger

I can't remember.

Second Pilot

You've forgotten.

Badger

Aye, you'd better have your pound back. Oh...

The nude organist is seated at his organ in the open air, with a lovely scarlet dressing-gown draped round his shoulders. It says on it 'Noel Coward' which is crossed out and 'Nude Organist' written underneath. He is holding forth to a journalist with a notepad who is nodding and interviewing him. Someone else holds a small tape recorder. Make-up ladies are adding the finishing touches. They bring him a mirror while he talks. Someone is taking photos of him, perhaps with flashbulbs.

Nude Man

Well I see my role in it as, er, how can I put it best - the nude man - as sort of symbolizing the two separate strands of existence, the essential nudity of man...

They realize that they are on camera. They remove the man's robe and clear the set. He grins at the camera and plays his chords. Cut to the announcer. He is sitting at his desk in the middle of a field but he is talking earnestly to a trendy girl reporter.

This new housing development in Bristol is one of the most interesting in the country. It's using a variety of new techniques: shock-proof curtain-walling, a central high voltage, self-generated electricity source, and extruded acrylic fiberglass fitments. It's also the first major housing project in Britain to be built entirely by characters from nineteenth-century English literature.

By, this time the pan has come to rest on a section of the site where various nineteenth-century literary figures are at work round a cement mixer: two ladies in crinolines, Bob Cratchett on his father's back, Heathcliff and Catherine throwing bricks to each other with smouldering passion, Nelson, Mr Beadle as foreman.

Arthur Huntingdon, who Helen Graham married as a young girl, and whose shameless conduct eventually drove her back to her brother Lawrence, in Anne Brontë's 'The Tenant of Wildfell Hall' describes why it's unique.

Huntingdon

Because sir, it is self-generating. Because we have harnessed here in this box the very forces of life itself. The very forces that will send Helen running back to beg forgiveness!

Cut to a close up of big pre-fabricated concrete slabs being hoisted into the air by a crane and start to pull out, as the commentator speaks, to reveal a crowd of nineteenth-centuty farmhands working on them.

Voice Over

The on-site building techniques involve the construction of twelve-foot walling blocks by a crowd of farmhands from 'Tess of the D'Urbervilles' supervised by the genial landlady, Mrs Jupp, from Samuel Butler's 'Way of All Flesh'.

Pan to reveal Mrs Jupp with a clipboard. Cut to voice over narrator in vision with a stick-mike, in front of an impressive piece of motorway interchange building. Behind him and working on the site are six angels, three devils, and Adam and Eve.

The camera tracks through a high-rise development area.

But even more modern building techniques are being used on an expanding new town site near Peterborough; here the Amazing Mystico and Janet can put up a block of flats by hypnosis in under a minute.

Mystico removes his cloak, gloves and top hat and hands them to Janet, who curtsies. He then makes several passes. Cut to stock film of flats falling down reversed so that they leap up. Cut back to Mystico and Janet. She hands him back his things as they make their way to their car, a little Austin 30.

Oh, it's 'Mortuary Quiz', Mr Wang...

Wang

Don't argue, Battersby.

We hear voices off. Officials at the door spring to attention. Enter a mayor with a chain round his neck, and an elderly peer of the realm who is standing on a small platform, pushed by an attendant.

Mayor

... This is our mortuary in here, Your Grace ...

Peer

I see, I see, I ... er ... I ... er ... I ... er ... I ... I can't think of anything to say about it.

Battersby and friend gather round the body. Wang joins them. They start to work away busily and eficiently on the corpse. We suddenly become aware that Badger is standing with them around the body.

Commentator

Hello, good afternoon and welcome to the second leg of the Olympic final of the men's Hide-and-Seek here in the heart of Britain's London. We'll be starting in just a couple of moments from now, and there you can see the two competitors Francisco Huron the Paraguayan, who in this leg is the seeker

Commentator

we see Francisco Huron darting about, looking behind things

Commentator

we see Don Roberts practising hiding

Commentator

our own Don Roberts from Hinckley in Leicestershire who, his trainer tells me, is at the height of his self-secreting form. And now in the first leg, which ended on Wednesday, Don succeeded in finding the Paraguayan in the new world record time of 11 years, 2 months, 26 days, 9 hours, 3 minutes, 27.4 seconds, in a sweetshop in Kilmarnock. And now they're under starter's orders.

We see Don Roberts and Francisco Huron standing side by side, poised, looking nervous.

He starts looking around the immediate locality suspiciously. We see a plane landing. There is a sign saying 'Benvenuto a Sardinia'. Cut to Don on a bicycle. Then running up a hill. Then going into castle. Running along corridors and eventualy pausing, looking around agitatedly, and then hiding behind a pillar. Occasionally he looks out nervously. Then cut to Francisco looking in shops in the Tottenham Court Road. Cut to studio 'Sportsview' desk with a Frank Bough man at it.

Frank Bough

Well, we'll be taking you back there as soon as there are any developments.

CAPTION: 'SIX YEARS LATER'

Cut back to desk. Frank Bough looks older.

Frank Bough

We've just heard that something is happening in the Hide-and-Seek final, so let's go straight over there.

Cut to film of Francisco Huron. He is wandering around looking for Don Roberts in a beach setting. The commentator is some way from him. He speaks quietly into a microphone.

Commentator

Hello again, and welcome to Madagascar, where Francisco Huron is seeking Don Roberts. And I've just been told that he has been told that he has been unofficially described as 'cold'. Ah, wait a minute.

Commentator

in the distance Francisco Huron consults with an official; the commentator moves out of shot briefly, then returns

Commentator

I've just been told that Huron has requested a plane ticket for Budapest! So he's definitely getting warmer. So we'll be back again in just a few years.

Cut to Frank Bough looking older. He is covered with cobwebs.

Frank Bough

Really beginning to hot up now.

CAPTION: 'FIVE YEARS, TWO MONTBS AND TWENTY-SIX DAYS LATER'

Cut to a Portuguese-looking setting. Francisco Huron looking round desperately and glancing at his watch.

Commentator

So here we are on the very last day of this fantastic final. Huron now has less than twelve hours left to find British ace Don Roberts. Early this morning he finished combing the outskirts of Lisbon and now he seems to have staked everything on one final desperate seek here in the Tagus valley. But Roberts is over fifteen hundred miles away, and it's beginning to look all over, bar the shouting. The sands of time are running out for this delving dago, this savior of seek, perspicacious Paraguayan. He's still desperately cold and it's beginning to look like another gold for Britain.

The camera shows Huron creeping up on a dustbin. He pauses, snatches off the lid and looks inside. He turns away disappointed then does double take and looks back into the bin. He pulls out a sardine tin with the word 'Sardines' very obvious. Shot of Huron's reaction as he suddenly gets a tremendous idea. He snaps his fingers and hails a taxi and gets in. Cut to plane landing. Same sign as before 'Benvenuto a Sardinia'. Francisco cycles past. Cut to him discarding the bike and running up the hill straight into the castle. He runs along corridors into the right room, up to the pillar and finds Don Roberts skulking behind. They both look very tense as they await the official result, then react in fury and frustration when it is announced by a blazered offical.

Official

The official result of the World Hide-and-Seek, Mr Don Roberts from Hinckley, Leicestershire, 11 years, 2 months, 26 days, 9 hours, 3 minutes, 27 seconds. Mr Francisco Huron, Paraguay, 11 years, a months, 26 days, 9 hours, 3 minutes, 27 seconds. The result - a tie.

Voice Over

A tie! Well what a fantastic result. Well the replay will start tomorrow at 7.30 a.m.

As they stand there the camera pans off them to a window and then zooms through the window to reveal a beach where there is a Redcoat.

Redcoat

Well hello again .... nice to be back ... glad to see the series has been doing well. Well now, sorry about Mon-trerx.

At this point two men run past in the background carrying a donkey. A third runs behind carrying a sign saying 'Donkey Rides' and winking and pointing at the donkey, they run out of picture.

Redcoat

That was a little item entitled Hide-and-Seek - very anarchic, very effective, not quite my cup of tea, but very nice for the younger people. Well, the next item the boys have put together takes place in a sitting room. Sorry it's just a sitting room, but the bank account's a bit low after the appallingly expensive production of 'Clochmerle'...

He is hit by Mr Robinson with a chicken. Robinson walks away and we follow him as he passes Badger in the foreground.

Badger

This is a totally free interruption and no money has exchanged hands whatever.

The camera doesn't pause at all on Badger and we continue panning with Robinson until he reaches the knight in amour. He hands the chicken to the knight. He walks away from knight and into the distance. Mix through to a modern sitting room. Mrs Robinson is eating alone at the table looking at the clock.

Mr Robinson

Sorry about that, darling...

Mr Robinson

he sits

She serves him some vegetables. He unfolds his napkin.

Mrs Robinson

Mr Robinson

Yes please, dear.

They sit and eat in silence. Suddenly the doorbell rings.

Mrs Robinson

Oh dear, that'll be the Cheap-Laughs from next door.

Various different doorbell sounds and chimes. Mr Robinson goes to the front door, and opens it. Standing outside are Mr and Mrs Cheap-Laugh. He is wearing a big floppy comedian's suit and a big bow tie and fright wig. She is a Mrs Equator sort of lady, with an enormous hairstyle, and dressed in very bad taste.

Mr Robinson

Come in.

Mr Cheap-Laugh

No! Just breathing heavily!

He and his wife roar with laughter. As he comes in he slips and falls on the mat. His wife puts a custard pie in his face. More roars of laughter.

Mrs Cheap-Laugh

Oh we just dropped in.

Mr Robinson

Would you like to come through...

We mix through to the exterior of a house at night. Shrieks of laughter, crushes of crockery. The two men with the donkey run past in road, the third man behind pointing to the sign.

SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'ONE EVENING WITH THE CHEAP-LAUGHS LATER'

The light comes on in hall. Cut to them in the hall at the front door.

Mr Cheap-Laugh

Well goodnight and give us a kiss.

Mr Cheap-Laugh

kisses Mrs Robinson

Mrs Cheap-Laugh

Oh thank you very much for a very nice evening.

Mr Cheap-Laugh

After you, dear.

He trips her up and she falls out into the darkness. We hear her shriek with laughter. Mr Cheap-Laugh drops his trousers, makes lavatory chain pulling sign and noise and hurls himself out after wife and disappears into the darkness. More laughter. The host shuts the door. They heave a sigh of relief and go back into the sitting room. The crockery on the table is all smashed in a heap on the floor with the table cloth. The standard lamp is broken in half. There are large splodges of food and wine splashes on the walls. Some glasses and a moustache are drawn on the Tretchikoff picture of the Chinese girl. Mrs Robinson flops down on the sofa. There is a farting cushion. She removes it, irritated.

Mrs Robinson

Oh honestly dear, why do we always have to buy everything just because the Cheap-Laughs have one?

He goes over to the wall cupboard for drinks. A bucket of whitewash is balanced on the half-open door. He opens the cupboard and the bucket of whitewash falls on him. Cut briefly to Mr Badger.

Badger

This is not an interruption at all.

Cut back to Mr Robinson. He pours himself a drink, without reacting to the whitewash.

Mr Robinson

It's just neighbourliness dear, that's all...

Mrs Robinson

I think we should try and lead our own lives from now on.

She opens a sewing box and a boxing glove on a spring comes out and hits her on the chin.

Mr Robinson

Can't you be serious for one moment?

He sits on the pouffe. The sixteen-ton weight falls on him. Cut to the exterior of the house. The lights go off downstairs and upstairs. The two men run past carrying a pantomime goose.

Mr Robinson

I'm sorry I was cross earlier.

Mr Robinson

Well yes, from now on we'll be like ourselves.

Mrs Robinson

Oh Roger...

Mr Robinson

Oh Beatrice.

The bed springs up and folds into the back wall of the bedroom. On the underneath of the bed is a presenter on a chair. The underneath of the bed also consists of a flat as for current affairs-type programme, with 'Probe' written above narrator.

Presenter

Many people in this country are becoming increasingly worried about bull-fighting. They say it's not only cruel, vicious and immoral, but also blatantly unfair. The bull is heavy, violent, abusive and aggressive with four legs and great sharp teeth, whereas the bull-fighter is only a small, greasy Spaniard. Given this basic inequality what can be done to make bull-fighting safer? We asked Brigadier Arthur Farquar-Smith, Chairman of the British Well-Basically Club.

Cut to a brigadier.

This is the planet Algon, fifth world in the system of Aldebaran, the Red Giant in the constellation of Sagittarius. Here an ordinary cup of drinking chocolate costs four million pounds, an immersion heater for the hot-water tank costs over six billion pounds, and a pair of split-crotch panties would be almost unobtainable.

Cut to James M'Burke sitting at a desk. 'Algon I' motifs everywhere. Another expert stands by a model of the planet, and there is a panel of experts at a long desk who are all obviously dummies. Everyone has one of those single earphones.

M'Burke

Well, our computers have been working all day to analyse the dramatic information that's come in from this first ever intergalactic probe, Algon I ...

M'Burke

suddenly very excited as he hears something over his earphone

M'Burke

very, indistinct pictures start to come through on the screen behind him

M'Burke

But we're now getting some live pictures through from Algon! Harry - Perhaps you could talk us through them.

Harry

Very little evidence of shopping facilities here .. there don't seem to be any large supermarkets. There may be some on-the-corner grocery stores behind those rocks, but it's difficult to tell from this angle. It does seem to suggest that most of the shopping here is by direct mail.

SUPERIMPOSED TELEPRINTER CAPTION: 'DIGESTIVE BISCUITS; £8,OOO,OOO PER PACKET'

Cut to James M'Burke.

M'Burke

Of course the big question that everyone's asking here is, what about those split-crotch parities? Are they going to be unobtainable throughout the Universe or merely on Algon itself? Professor?

Cut to a professor sitting beside a contour model of an area of Algon. It has a little model of the probe marking where it has landed.

SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'PROFESSOR HERMAN KHAN, DIRECTOR OF THE INSTITUTE OF SPLIT-CROTCH PANTIES'

Professor

We must remember that Algon is over 75,000 miles wide. The probes come down to this area here and we're really only getting signals from a radius of only thirty or forty miles around the probe. Split-crotch panties, or indeed any items of what we scientists call, 'Sexy Underwear' or 'Erotic Lingerie' may be much more plentiful on other parts of the planet.

Camera pans to include M'Burke.

M'Burke

Professor, you were responsible for finding Scanty-Panties and Golden Goddess High-Lift Bras on planets which were never thought able to sustain life, and now that man has discovered a new galaxy do you think we're going to see underwear become even naughtier?

Professor

Oh naughtier and naughtier.

SUPERIMPOSED TELEPRINTER CAPTION: 'NO BANANAS ON ALGON'

M'Burke

Well so much for that ... But of course, the probe itself has excited a great deal of interest... for it contains uranium-based dual transmission cells entirely re-charged by solar radiation, which can take off a bra and panties in less than fifteen seconds. It is, of course, the first piece of space hardware to be specially designed to undress ladies, and so there are bound to be some teething troubles ... such as how to cope with the combination of elastic-sided boots and tights.

He produces the bottom half of a tailor's dummy wearing boots and tights with panties over the tights halfway down. On the screen behind, more dim indecipherable TV pictures from Algon.

M'Burke

But I think we're getting some pictures now from Algon itself, and it looks as though ... yes! The satellite has found a bird! The probe has struck crumpet and she looks pretty good too! Professor?

Professor

Ja - she's a real honey!

All we see on the screen is a blurred female figure.

M'Burke

Well the pictures are a bit sporadic... I think probably... the solar radiation during the long journey to Algon...

M'Burke

the screen goes blank

M'Burke

Hoy! Look! Oh dear, I'm sorry we've lost contact. We'll try and re-establish contact with Algon...

The camera pulls out to reveal the sixteen-ton weight poised above him. As the picture fades the weight falls on him.

Outside a shop. A sign reads 'Tuder Job Agency - Jobs a Speciality'. A man enters the shop. Inside it is decorated in Tudor style. The assistant is in Tudor dress.

Assistant

Morning, sir, can I help you?

Customer

Yes, yes... I wondered if you have any part-time vacancies on your books.

Assistant

Part-time, I'll have a look, sir.

Assistant

he gets out a book and looks through it

Assistant

Let me look now. We've got, ah yes, Sir Walter Raleigh is equipping another expedition to Virginia; he needs traders and sailors. Vittlers needed at the Court of Philip of Spain, oh, yes, and they want master joiners and craftsmen for the building of the Globe Theatre.

Customer

I see. Have you anything a bit more modern, you know, like a job on the buses, or digging the underground?

Assistant

Oh no, we only have Tudor jobs.

Customer

That can't be very profitable, can it?

Assistant

Well, you'd be surprised, actually sir. The Tudor economy's booming, ever since Sir Humphrey Gilbert opened up the Northwest passage to Cathay, and the Cabots' expansion in Canada, there's been a tremendous surge in exports, and trade with the Holy Roman Empire is going... no, quite right, it's no good at all.

Customer

What?

Assistant

It's a dead loss. We haven't put anyone in a job since 1625.

Customer

I see.

Assistant

That's all?

Assistant

That's all you say?

Customer

Yes.

Assistant

No, no, we were the tops then. Drake got all his sailors here. Elizabeth, we supplied the archbishops for her coronation. Shakespeare started off from here as a temp. Then came James the First and the bottom fell out of the Tudor jobs. 1603 - 800 vacancies filled, 1604 - 40, 1605 - none, 1606 - none. The rest of the Stuart period nothing. Hanoverians nothing. Victorians nothing. Saxe-Coburgs nothing. Windsors... what did you want?

Customer

Dirty books, please.

Assistant

Right.

Assistant

produces selection of mags from under counter

Assistant

Sorry about the Tudor bit, but you can't be too careful, you know. Have a look through these.

Customer

Have you got anything a bit... er...

Assistant

A bit stronger?

Assistant

Hold on ... a... My Lord of Warwick!

Second Assistant

Second Assistant

'Allo!

Assistant

Raise high the drawbridge. Gloucester's troops approach.

Second Assistant

Right.

Assistant

Can't be too careful you know, sir.

The wall of the Tudor shop slides back to reveal the interior of a Soho dirty bookshop in the back room - a bare room with a counter and magazines in racks on the walls at eye-level. Three drably dressed men are thumbing through books. One of them is a vicar, one of them is gathering a huge pile. Behind the counter is a Soho toughie in Tudor gear showing books to Mr Nid - a tweedy, rather academic, respectable-looking man of senior years. The customer goes through, and the wall slides back.

Second Assistant

There's a 'Bridget - Queen of the Whip'.

Nid

Yes...

Second Assistant

Or 'Naughty Nora'... or there's this one: 'Doug, Bob and Gordon Visit the

Nid

Mmmm... I see ... you don't have anything specially about Devon and Cornwall?

Second Assistant

No. I'm afraid not, sir.

Nid

The one I was really after was Arthur Hotchkiss's 'Devonshire Country Churches'.

Second Assistant

Well how about this, sir: 'Bum Biters'.

Nid

No ... not really ... I don't suppose you have any general surveys of English Church architecture?

Second Assistant

No, it's not really our line, sir.

Nid

No, I see. Well, never mind I'll just take the 'Lord Lieutenant in Nylons' then, and these two copies of 'Piggie Parade'. Thank you.

Second Assistant

Right, sir.

Second Assistant

Right.

He presses a button below counter and the wall slides back. The man with the big pile of books comes up to counter.

Man

Just these, then.

Enter Gaskell in Tudor gear. The wall closes up behind him.

Gaskell

All right. This is a raid. My name is Superintendent Gaskell and this is Sergeant Maddox.

Second Assistant

Ah! Sir Philip Sidney. 'Tis good to see thee on these shores again.

Gaskell

Shut up.

Second Assistant

Your suit is fair and goodly cut. Was't from Antwerp?

Gaskell

Shut up. It's a disguise. Right! Confiscate the smutty books, Maddox.

Second Assistant

Sir Philip!. Prithee nay!

Gaskell

Listen, mate! Don't come that Philip Sidney bit with me. I'm not a bloody Tudor at all. I'm Gaskell of the Vice Squad and this is Sergeant Maddox.

They all look at him blankly. He looks to Maddox for support and realizes he isn't there.

Gaskell

Maddox! Where's he gone?

Second Assistant

Sir Philip, prithee rest awhile.

Gaskell

Look. This is the last time. I'm warning you, I'm not Sir Philip Bleeding Sidney. I am Superintendent Harold Gaskell and this is a raid.

Everybody resumes their book-buying and ignores him. At the counter the assistant is still totting up the huge pile of books.

Second Assistant

That'll be 540 quid sir.

Man

Oh, I'll just have this one then.

Man

takes top one

Gaskell

Maddox!

Gaskell

Gaskell

Gaskell

people start to leave through the rear door of the shop; Gaskell blocks it

Gaskell

Where are you going?

Customer

I'm going home.

Gaskell

Right.

Gaskell

looks for his notebook but it's not in his Tudor clothing

Gaskell

I'll remember you. Don't you worry. I'll remember you...

Customer

Pray good, Sir Philip, that you...

Gaskell

Don't you start! Maddox!

Gaskell

the customer leaves; other customers start to leave

Gaskell

the vicar comes up to counter

Gaskell

the vicar leaves guiltily

Second Assistant

Farewell, good Sir Philip.

He goes out carrying a pile of magazines. Then the vicar goes, followed by the Tudor man.

Gaskell

Hey, stop!

Gaskell

the door slams; Gaskell turns and looks round the empty shop; pause

He rushes up to the sliding wall and beats on it. Then he turns and makes for the little back door and goes through.

Gaskell

You'll never get away with this, you porn merchant. Blimey!

He stops and gapes. We cut to his eye-line to see he is standing in a beautiful, green, Tudor garden. In the distance a Tudor house. A girl is sitting on a stone bench, sobbing. Gaskell walks towards her, bewildered.

The girl looks up at him with beseeching eyes. She is young and beautiful.

Girl

Oh good sir, how glad I am to see thee come. Forgive me weeping, but my love has gone.

Gaskell

Er, listen. My name is Caskell ... Superintendent Caskell of Vice Squad. Myself and Sergeant Maddox are on a raid. We are not Tudor people. We are the police.

An Elizabethan gentleman appears through the trees.

Father

Frances, what idleness is this? Why, good Sir Philip Sidney,

Father

he bows extravagantly to Gaskell

Father

What hast thee here?

Girl

turning to Caskell with bated breath

Girl

You are Sir Philip Sidney?

Gaskell

... Possibly... but I may be Superintendent Gaskell of the Vice Squad.

Father

Ah good, Sir Philip, thy sharp-tongued wit has not deserted thee. Come. Let us eat and drink. Stay with us awhile.

Gaskell

All right, sir. I think I will.

They walk off together arm in arm into the idyllic country garden. The girl looks after them with hope in her eyes. Bring up Elizabethan music.

SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'THE LIFE OF SIR PHILIP SIDNEY'

Mix through to a Tudor dining room. At the table a group of Tudor gentry are sitting listening to Gaskell. Evidence of a banquet, and two minstrels in attendance. Gaskell has obviously just finished a story. Applause and laughter.

Gaskell

. .. then did we bust the Harry Tony mob, who did seek to import Scandinavian filth via Germany. For six years they cleaned up a packet - the day I got whiff of them through a squealer and within one week did a mop-up right good. They're now languishing doing five years bird in Parkhurst.

Applause. They are all very impressed. Cut to exterior. A messenger on a horse rides full pelt straight towards the camera. It is dusk. He stops outside the Elizabethan house, leaps off and dashes into the house. Cut to interior again. They are still all laughing from his last story. The messenger bursts into room.

Messenger

Sir Philip. The Spaniards have landed in the Netherlands. My Lord Walsingham needs you there forthwith.

Gaskell

Let's go.

Cut to exterior. Gaskell is seated on the back of the messenger's horse and they gallop off. The dinner crowd are standing waving on the doorstep.

Dinner Crowd

Good luck, Sir Philip!

Cut to a British standard fluttering in the breeze against the blue sky. Fanfare. Two Elizabethan gentlemen, and four men dressed as Elizabethan soldiers are standing on a cliff top. Gaskell strides up to them, and takes up position on topmost point of the knoll.

Gaskell

Where are the Spaniards?

Elizabethan Gent

Down below Sir Philip, their first boats are landing even now.

Shot of a sailing-galley seen from above.

Gaskell

Right, you stay here, I'll go and get them.

Elizabethan Gent

Sir Philip! Not alone!

Cut to the beach. Suspense music. Gaskell strides up to the camera, until he is towering over it. The music reaches crescendo.

Gaskell

Allo allo! What's going on here?

Cut to beached rowing boat piled high with bundles of dirty magazines. Two Spaniards are unloading it.

Spaniard

Ees nothing, Señor, ees just some literature.

Gaskell

I know what literature is, you dago dustbin. I also know what porn is.

Gaskell

pulls out a loose magazine and brandishes it

Gaskell

What's this then eh?

Spaniard

It is one of Lope De Vega's latest play, Señor.

Gaskell

'Toledo Tit Parade'? What sort of play's that?

Spaniard

It's very visual, Señor.

Gaskell

Right. I'm taking this lot in the name of Her Gracious Majesty Queen Elizabeth.

Spaniard

Oh, but Señor.

Gaskell

Don't give me any trouble. Just pile up these baskets of filth and come with me.

The second Spaniard leaps out of the boat with a drawn sword and they both engage Gaskell in a fight. Then we start to draw away from them, leaving them tiny dots in the distance fighting. Fight music over all this and voice over.

Voice Over

The battle raged long and hard, but as night fell Sidney overcame the Spaniards. 6,000 copies of 'Tits and Bums' and 4,000 copies of 'Shower Sheila' were seized that day. The tide of Spanish porn was stemmed. Sir Philip Sidney returned to London in triumph.

Cut to stock film of Elizabethan London street during celebrations.

Covered in glory, Sir Philip rode home to Pensburst to see his beloved wife... but all was not well.

Gaskell runs up outside another Tudor house and strides in. Cut to interior of an Elizabethan room - panelled walls, log fire, latticed windows, etc. Sir Philip's wife is sitting reading. Gaskell enters.

Gaskell

Good evening all, my love. I have returned safe from the Low Countries.

Gaskell

she hurriedly hides the book she is reading under some knitting and starts whistling

Gaskell

What are thou reading, fair one?

Wife

Oh, 'tis nothing, husband.

Gaskell

I can see 'tis

Gaskell

something

Gaskell

.

Wife

'Tis one of Shakespeare's latest works.

Gaskell picks up the book and reads the title.

Gaskell

Oh ...'Gay Boys in Bondage' What, is't - tragedy? Comedy?

Wife

'Tis a... er... 'tis a story of a man's great love for his... fellow men.

Gaskell

How fortunate we are indeed to have such a poet on these shores.

Wife

Indeed. How was the war, my lord?

Gaskell

The Spaniards were defeated thrice. Six dozen chests of hardcore captured.

Wife

trying to look innocent

Wife

Hast brought home any spoils of war?

Gaskell

Yes, good my wife, this fair coat trimmed with ermine.

Wife

without enthusiasm

Wife

Oh, lovely, nowt else?

Gaskell

No, no fair lady. The rest was too smutty.

He settles himself down in front of his lady's feet and the fire.

Gaskell

Now, my good wife. Whilst I rest, read to me a while from Shakespeare's 'Gay Boys in Bondage'.

The wife looks a trifle taken aback but reluctantly opens the book and starts to read with a resigned air.

Wife

Yes... my lord ... 'Gay Boys in Bondage' ... Ken, 25, is a mounted policeman with a difference... and what a difference. Even Roger is surprised and he's...

Wife

she looks slightly, sick with guilt

Wife

he's used to real men ...

Gaskell

'Tis like 'Hamlet' ... what a genius!

Wife

'But who's going to do the cooking tonight? Roddy's got a mouthful...'

Enter Maddox - a modern-day plain-clothed policeman.

Maddox

All right, this is a raid.

The wife screams, Gaskell leaps to his feet.

Wife

Oh! We are disgraced!

Gaskell

There you are, Maddox!

Maddox

Cut the chat... and get in the van.

Gaskell

Maddox! You recognize me...

Maddox

Indeed I do, Sir Philip Sidney, and sad I am to see you caught up in this morass of filth,

Maddox

he picks up the book

Maddox

ooh - that's a long one.

Wife

Oh oh... the glorious name of Sidney is besmirched ... all is lost ... oh alas the day.

Gaskell

Shut up! I know this man - this is my old mate Sergeant Maddox...

Maddox

You'll do time for this.

Gaskell

Oh Maddox - it's me - Gaskell ... 'F' division down at Acton ... Inspector Arthur Frodwell.

Maddox

Come on Sidney.

Maddox

he bundles them both out

Maddox

And you, miss.

Gaskell

I'm not Sir Philip bleedin' Sidney .... and where were you? We could have mopped up that Tudor shop...

They are bundled out. Maddox pauses only to pick a book from the bookcase near the door.

Maddox

Ooh! That's a good one!

Cut to outside a modern theatre stage-door. Gaskell, still protesting, and Mrs Sidney are bundled out and into a police van. As it drives off, it reveals on the side of the theatre a poster saying 'The Aldwych Theatre, The Royal Shakespeare Company Presents 'Gay Boys In Bondage' By William Shakespeare'.

An animated excerpt from this little known Shakespearian masterpiece leads us to a table outside a restaurant. A young couple are sitting blissfully at it.

She

It's nice here, darling, isn't it.

He

It's beautiful, it's Paris all over again.

Enter a vicar, dressed normally but has bald wig with fright hair at sides. He carries a suitcase.

Vicar

Excuse me, do you mind if I join you?

He

Er, no... no... no... not at all.

Vicar

Are you

Vicar

Vicar

you don't mind?

He

Yes, yes, absolutely.

Vicar

You're sure I won't be disturbing you?

He

No, no.

Vicar

You're absolutely sure I won't be disturbing you?

She

No, no really.

Vicar

Good. Because I don't want to disturb you. Specially as you're being so kind about me not disturbing you.

He

Oh, no, no, we don't mind, do we, darling?

She

Oh no, darling.

Vicar

Good, so I can go ahead and join you then? Can I?

Both

Yes ... yes...

Vicar

Won't be disturbing?

Both

No. No.

Vicar

Good, good. You're very kind.

Vicar

Let alone when I specifically tell them about my being disturbing.

He

Vicar

No, absolutely, absolutely, that's what I always say.

Vicar

he produces plates from his case and smashes them on the table

Vicar

he produces a rubber crab suspended from a ping-pong paddle and a rubber baby doll and bobs them up and down, making loud silly noises as he does so

Vicar

he breaks more plates and squirts shaving cream over his head; he and she get up to leave

He

We must be getting on.

Vicar

I knew I'd disturb you ... I knew I'd disturb you ...

Vicar

Vicar

It always happens ... whenever I've found someone I really think I'm going to be able to get on with...

He

No, the only thing is, you see, we're going to be a little bit late.

She

Let's stay.

He

Well, just a little bit... I mean, we will be late if we don't...

Thripshaw

Certainly.

Thripshaw

Burrows

I'm up to here with it, I'm sick to death. I can't take you any longer so I've come to see it.

Thripshaw

Ah, now this is your problem with words.

Burrows

This is my problem with words. Oh, that seems to have cleared it. 'Oh I come from Alabama with my banjo on my knee'. Yes, that seems to be all right. Thank you very much.

Thripshaw

I see. But recently you have been having this problem with your word order.

Burrows

Well, absolutely, and what makes it worse, sometimes at the end of a sentence I'll come out with the wrong fusebox.

Thripshaw

Fusebox?

Burrows

And the thing about saying the wrong word is a) I don't notice it, and b) sometimes orange water given bucket of plaster.

Thripshaw

Yes, tell me more about your problem.

Burrows

Well as I say, you'd just be talking and out'll pudenda the wrong word and ashtray's your uncle. So I'm really strawberry about it.

Thripshaw

Burrows

It's so embarrassing when my wife and I go to an orgy.

No, an orgy. We live in Esher.

The door opens and the vicar enters as if from the end of a service. He takes off his cassock and is hanging it up. At one side of the set is a sculpture on a plinth. It is the vicar's head, but with an enormously long nose. Mr Kirkham has followed the vicar in. He is an earnest, quiet, self-effacing soul, with a tortured conscience.

Vicar

Come in.

Kirkham

I wondered if I could have a word with you for a moment.

Vicar

By all means ... by all means, sir. Do sit down.

Vicar

they look round for a chair

Vicar

Ah, sit on the desk here.

Kirkham

Thank you.

Vicar

Now then, a glass of sherry?

Kirkham

No... no thank you...

Vicar

getting a bottle from the cupboard

Vicar

Are you sure? I'm going to have some.

Kirkham

Well, if you're having some, yes then, perhaps, vicar.

Vicar

slightly taken aback

Vicar

Oh... well there's only just enough for me.

Kirkham

Well in that case I won't, don't worry.

Vicar

You see, if I split what's left, there'd be hardly any left for me at all.

Kirkham

Well, I'm not a great sherry drinker.

Vicar

Good! So, I can have it all ... now then what's the problem?

Kirkham

Well, just recently I've begun to worry about...

The vicar has been looking through his desk. He produces a bottle of sherry in triumph.

Vicar

Ah! I've found another bottle! You can have some now if you want to.

Kirkham

Well... yes, perhaps a little...

Vicar

Oh you don't have to. I can drink the whole bottle.

Kirkham

Well in that case, no...

Vicar

Good! That's another bottle for me. Do go on.

The vicar opens the bottle and pours himself a glass. As soon as he has drunk it he replenishes it again.

Kirkham

I've begun to worry recently that...

There is a knock on the door.

Vicar

Come in!

A smooth man, Mr Husband, enters carrying a smart little briefcase.

Vicar

Ah, Mr Husband ... this is Mr Kirkham, one of my parishioners, this is Mr Husband of the British Sherry Corporation...

Kirkham

Look, look, perhaps I'd better come back later...

Vicar

No, no ... no do stay here. Have a sherry... you won't be long will you, Husband?

Husband

Oh no, vicar... it's just a question of signing a few forms.

The vicar pours Husband a sherry.

Vicar

There we are... there we are, Mr Husband. Now, how about you, Mr Kirkham?

Kirkham

Well only if there's enough.

Vicar

Oh well, there's not much now.

Kirkham

Oh, in that case... no... I won't bother.

Vicar

pouring himself one

Vicar

Good. Right... now, then, what is the problem, Husband?

Husband

Well, vicar, I've made enquiries with our shippers and the most sherry they can ship in any one load is 12,000 gallons.

Vicar

And how many glasses is that?

Husband

That's roughly 540,000 glasses, Vicar.

Vicar

That's excellent, Husband, excellent.

Husband

Yes... it means you can still keep your main sherry supply on the roof, but you can have an emergency supply underneath the vestry of 5,000 gallons.

Vicar

Yes... and I could have dry sherry on the roof and Amontillado in the underground tank!

Husband

Absolutely.

The vicar signs a form that Husband hands to him.

Vicar

Excellent work, Husband, excellent work.

Husband

Not at all, vicar, you're one of our best customers... you and the United States. Well goodbye.

Husband

he leaves

Vicar

Terrific. Now then, Mr Kirkham

Vicar

pouring himself anothter sherry

Vicar

I am so sorry... do go on.

Kirkham

Well, it's just that recently I've begun to worry about...

Vicar

Well, look...

Kirkham

I sometimes ask myself - does the Bible intend...

A group of Spanish singers in full national costumes with guitars bursts into the Vestry, noisily singing a song praising Amontillado. A man in an extravagant Spanish costume rushes in. His hat has a sign on it saying: 'Sherry, the drink of champions'. Two girls come in bearing maracas and Carmen Miranda style hats. Mr Kirkham looks fed up. The Spaniards finish their song, noisily.

Man

What did you want?

Vicar

Dirty books, please.

As they carry out their transactions, noisily, we cut to the credits, rolled over a shot of the dirty postcards scetion of the Tudor dirty bookshop. The credits read:

Slow pan across idyllic countryside. We see a traditional eighteenth-century coach and horses travelling along the valley floor. Suddenly a highwayman, Dennis Moore, spurs his horse forward and rides up to the coach brandishing pistols.

Moore

Stand and deliver! Drop that gun!

Moore

the coach comes to a halt; the drivers hold up their hands but a postillion reaches for a gun; Moore shoots him

Moore

every

Moore

heads are coming out of the coach and peering

Moore

You see the three trees, the third from the left and back a bit - that one - I reckon I clould hit that four times out of five...on a good day. Say with this wind...say, say, seven times out of ten...

Squire

What, that tree there?

Moore

Which one?

Squire

The big beech with the sort of bare branch coming out of the top left.

Moore

No, no, no, not that one.

Girl

No, no, he means the one over there. Look, you see that one.

Squire

Yes.

Girl

Well now, go two along to the right.

Coachman

Just near that little bush.

Girl

Well, it's the one just behind it.

Squire

Ah! The elm.

Moore

No, that's not an elm. An elm's got sort of great clumps of leaves like that. That's either a beech or a...er...hornbeam.

Parson

A hornbeam?

Moore

Oh, no not a hornbeam, What's the tree that has a leaf with sort of regular veins coming out and the veins go all the way out to the...

Girl

Serrated?

Moore

...to the serrated edges.

Parson

A willow!

Moore

That's right.

Parson

That's nothing like a willow.

Moore

Well it doesn't matter, anyway. I can hit it seven times out of ten, that's the point.

Parson

Never a willow.

Moore

Shut up! This is a hold-up, not a botany lesson. Right, now my fine friends, no false moves please. I want you to hand over all the lupins you've got.

Squire

Lupins?

Moore

Yes, lupins. Come on, come on.

Parson

What do you mean, lupins?

Moore

Don't try to play for time.

Parson

I'm not, you mean the flower lupin?

Moore

Yes, that's right.

Squire

Well, we haven't got any lupins.

Girl

Honestly.

Moore

Look, my fine friends. I happen to know that this is the Lupin Express.

Squire

You must be out of your tiny mind.

Moore

Get out of the coach. Come on, get out!

Moore

they do so indicating that Moore is a loony; he dismounts and enters the coach; he immediately comes out with an enormous armful of lupins

Moore

he jumps on horse and rides away

Squire

Well, so much for the lupins.

Montage of Dennis Moore, galloping through the sun-dappled glades, a little village, more glades and forrest and arriving at a little peasant-type woodcutter's hut where two terribly poor peasants greet him and recieve the lupins with a neutral reaction. During this the following song is heard.

Song

Mrs O

Mrs Trepidatious

Well, Petula Clark says burst them early, but David Frost...

Mrs O

No, the stars in the paper, you cloth-eared heap of anteater's catarrh, the zodiacal signs, the horoscopic fates, the astrological portents, the omens, the genethliac prognostications, the mantalogical harbingers, the vaticinal utterances, the fatidical premonitory uttering of the mantalogical omens - what do the bleeding stars in the paper predict, forecast, prophesy, foretell, prognosticate...

Mrs O

Aquarius, Scorpio, Virgo, Derry and Toms. April 29th to March 22nd. Even dates only.

Mrs Trepidatious

Well what does it presage?

Mrs O

You have green, scaly skin, and a soft yellow underbelly with a series of fin-like ridges running down your spine and tail. Although lizardlike in shape, you can grow anything up to thirty feet in length with huge teeth that can bite off great rocks and trees. You inhabit arid sub-tropical zones and wear spectacles.

Mrs Trepidatious

It's very good about the spectacles.

Mrs O

It's amazing.

Mrs Trepidatious

Mm ... what's yours, Irene?

Mrs O

Basil.

Mrs Trepidatious

I'm sorry, what's yours, Basil?

Mrs O

No. That's my star sign, Basil...

Mrs O

You have green, scaly skin and a series of yellow underbellies running down your spine and tail ...

Mrs Trepidatious

That's exactly the same!

Mrs O

Try number one ... what's Aquarius?

Mrs Trepidatious

It's a zodiacal sign.

Mrs O

I know that, what does it say in the paper Mrs Flan-and-pickle?

Mrs Trepidatious

All right... Oh! It says, 'a wonderful day ahead'. You will be surrounded by family and friends. Roger Moore will drop in for lunch, bringing Tony Curtis with him. In the afternoon a substantial cash sum will come your way. In the evening Petula Clark will visit your home accompanied by Mike Samrues singers. She will sing for you in your own living room. Before you go to bed, Peter Wyngarde will come and declare his undying love for you.

Mrs O

Urghh! What's Scorpio?

Mrs Trepidatious

Oh, that's very good. 'You will have lunch with a schoolfriend of Duane Eddy's, who will insist on whistling some of Duane's greatest instrumental hits. In the afternoon you will die, you will be buried...'

A doctor is lowered on a wire.

Doctor

Good morning.

Mrs O

Oh, morning, doctor.

Doctor

How's the old arm this morning, Mrs Ikon?

Mrs Trepidatious

Oh, it's still hanging off at the shoulder.

Doctor

Good, well lets have a look at it, shall we?

Doctor

he tries unsuccessfully to open his bag

Doctor

Oh damn, damn, damn, damn... damn this wretched bag... oh the wretched, damn, bloody, little bag. It's the one thing I hate about being a doctor - it's this wretched bloody little bag!

He smashes a chair over it and finally produces a revolver and shoots the lock off. It opens and is stuffed full of pound notes, some of which spill out. He feels inside... eventually pulls out a stethoscope.

Doctor

What's that doing here?

Doctor

he throws it away

Cut to another doctor walking along a street. The stethoscope flies out of window and lands on him.

Second Doctor

brushing it off

Second Doctor

Eurgggh!

Cut back to the first doctor still rummaging in black bag. Eventually, he produces a pair of black kid gloves and a black handkerchief. He folds it and puts it on and points the gun at Mrs Trepidatious.

Doctor

Hand over the money.

Doctor

she goes to a sideboard opens the bottom drawer and gets out a money box which she gives to him

Doctor

she looks scared; he jabs the gun at her; she goes over to a painting of a wall-safe on the wall and pushes it aside to reveal an identical wall-safe underneath. She opens it and a hand comes out holding a money box; she takes and gives it to the doctor

Doctor

he opens his mac like a flasher; they scream and jump

Doctor

he starts to go up

Mrs Trepidatious

Thank you, doctor.

Mrs Trepidatious

he disappears

Cut to a hospital ward. A man in bed, a chair with his clothes on it at the foot of the bed. A doctor entes and goes right for the jacket and starts to feel in the pockets.

Doctor

Morning, Mr Henson ... How are we today?

Henson

Not too bad, doctor.

Doctor

OK, take it easy ...

Doctor

he empties his wallet and puts it back

Doctor

Expecting any postal orders this week?

Henson

No.

Doctor

Righto.

A nurse comes and gets the loose change. The doctor goes to the next bed where there is a man entirely in traction.

Doctor

Ah, Mr Rodgers, have you got your unemployment benefit please? Right. Well can you write me a cheque then... please?

The patient writes him a cheque. He goes to the foot of the bed. There is a graph with a money symbol on it. He marks it down further.

Doctor

Thank you very much. Soon have you down to nothing. Ah, Mr Millichope.

Doctor

he smiles and leaves, passing a man with a saline drip full of coins; chink of money

Buckingham

Thank you, Grantley.

Grantley

Ladies, may I introduce to you the man who prophesied that a German monarch would soon embroil this country in continental affairs.

First Lady

Oh, how so, my lord?

Buckingham

Madam, you will recall that prior to his accession our gracious sovereign George had become involved in the long standing Northern War, through his claims to Bremen and Verdun. These duchies would provide an outlet to the sea of the utmost value to Hanover. The Treaty of Westphalia has assigned them to Sweden.

Grantley

In 1648.

Buckingham

Exactly.

Grantley

Meanwhile Frederick William of Denmark, taking advantage of the absence of Charles XII, seized them; 1712.

Second Lady

Oh yes!

First Lady

It all falls into place. More wine?

Grantley

Oh, thank you.

Buckingham

However, just prior to his accession, George had made an alliance with Frederick William of Prussia, on the grounds of party feeling.

Grantley

While Frederick William had married George's only daughter.

First Lady

I remember the wedding.

But chiefly through concern at the concerted action against Charles XII...

Towards the end of this he arrives at the same peasant's cottage as before, dismounts and runs to the cottage door. He pauses. From inside the cottage we hear quiet moaning. Cut to inside the cottage. In this rude hut, lit by a single candle, the female peasant lies apparently dying on a bunk. Lupins are everywhere, in the fire, on the bed, a large pile of them forms a pillow. The female peasant is moaning and the male peasant is kneeling beside her offering her a lupin. Moore enters slowly.

Yet fear, not like an aged florin, can so disseminate men's eyes, that fortune, straining at a kissing touch may stop her ceaseless search to sport amidst the rampant thrust of time, and bring the thing undone to pass by that with which the cock may chance an arm.

Cut to a wider shot to show that he is in an off-licence. Mr Bones is behind the counter.

Mr Bones

Well that's all very well, sir, but this is an off-licence.

Oh. Just a bottle of sherry then, please.

Mr Bones

Certainly... Amontillado?

McGough

Yes, I think Amontillado, finely grown ... well chosen from the casque of Pluto's hills, cell'd deep within the vinous soil of Spain, wrench'd thence from fiery regions of the sun...

Mr Bones

Yes, yes sir. Just one bottle?

McGough

Just one bottle. Just one jot. Just one tittle. That's the lot.

McGough

I'm sorry. I'm afraid I've caught poetry.

Mr Bones

Oh really? Well, don't worry, sir - I used to suffer from short stories.

McGough

Really? When?

Mr Bones

Oh, once upon a time ... there lived in Wiltshire a young Chap called Dennis Moore. Now Dennis was a highwayman by profession ...

Mr Bones

we ripple through to Dennis Moore riding along with a big bag of swag

Mr Bones

... and for several months he had been stealing from the rich to give to the poor. One day...

Mix through to a shot of Dennis Moore arriving with another bag of goodies. The peasants who greet him are by now very smartly dressed and the cottage has been refurbished.

RSM

It's the fifth state that a Scotsman can achieve, sir. He's got to finish himself off by lunchtime or he thinks he's let down the Emperor, sir.

Captain

Well, can't we get him out of it?

RSM

Oh, I dunno how to, sir. Our Kamikaze instructor, Mr Yashimoto, was so good he never left Tokyo airport.

Oh never mind... right ... no time to lose.

Look, I don't think you've quite got the hang of this phrase, sergeant major.

The same frontage of smart London salon as before. Only this time the big sign reads 'No Time To Lose Advice Centre'. The same bowler-hatted man goes in. The same interior, same desk. A consultant sits behind it, and motions for the man to sit down.

Consultant

Morning, no time to lose ...

Consultant

he picks up a card which reads 'no time to lose'; he keeps flashing it every so often

Consultant

Now then, how were you thinking of using the phrase?

He pulls down a blind behind him on the right which also reads 'no time to lose' in large letters. He lets it go and it rolls up again fast.

Man

Well, I was thinking of using it ... er .. like .., well ... 'good morning dear, what is in no time to lose?'

Consultant

Er yes ... well ... you've not quite got the hang of that, have you.

He gets out a two-foot-square cube with 'no time to lose' in the same lettering as it always is, and puts it on the desk. He points to this in a manic way with a forefinger. He has the words 'no time to lose' on the back of his hand.

Consultant

Consultant

to stop the manic fit he reaches inside desk, pours a drink from a bottle on which is written 'no time to lose'

Consultant

Now, you want to use this phrase in everyday conversation, is that right?

Man

Yes, that's right.

Consultant

Yes ... good ...

He stands up, makes a strange noise, and flings the back of his jacket up over his head revealing 'no time to lose' written on the inside of the back lining of his jacket, upside down so that it is the right way up when it is revealed.

Man

You see my wife and I have never had a great deal to say to each other ...

Man

tragic, heart-rending music creeps in under the dialogue

Man

In the old days we used to find things to say, like 'pass the sugar'... or, 'that's my flannel', but in the last ten or fifteen years there just hasn't seemed to be anything to say, and anyway I saw your phrase advertised in the paper and I thought, that's the kind of thing I'd like to say to her...

The consultant pushes down a handle and a large screen comes up in front of him. On it is written 'no time to lose'. He burts through the paper.

Consultant

Yes, well, what we normally suggest for a beginner such as yourself, is that you put your alarm clock back ten minutes in the morning, so you can wake up, look at the clock and use the phrase immediately.

Consultant

he holds up the card briefly

Consultant

Shall we try it?

All right - I'll be the alarm clock. When I go off, look at me and use the phrase, OK?

Cut back to the gates of Edinburgh Castle. Dawn. Music. As the voice starts the gates open and a lorry emerges.

Voice Over

So it was that on a cold November morning, RSM Urdoch and Sapper MacDonald, one of the most highly trained Kamikaze experts the Scottish Highlands have ever witnessed, left on a mission which was to... oh I can't go on with this drivel.

By this time we have cut to a close up of the cab to show RSM Urdoch at the wheel, with MacDonald beside him. MacDonald has a revolver and is apparently having an unsuccessful game of Russian roulette.

RSM

All right, MacDonald, no time to lose.

Suddenly MacDonald hurls himself out of the lorry.

MacDonald

Aaaaaaugh!

The RSM slams the brakes on. Skidding noises. Cut to shot of the lorry skidding to a halt. The RSM leaps out, picks up MacDonald who is lying on the floor hitting himself, and loads him into the back of the lorry. He gets back into the lorry and they start off again. They haven't gone more than a few yards before we see MacDonald leap out of the back of the lorry, race round to the front and throw himself down in front of the lorry. The lorry runs right over him. He picks himself up after it has gone, races up to the front and tries it again... and again... and again... and again... and again...

Cut to the captain, standing in front of a huge map. He points with a stick.

Captain

Well, that's the mission - now here's the method. RSM Murdoch will lull the enemy into a false sense of security by giving them large quantities of money, a good home, and a steady job. Then, when they're upstairs with the wife, Sapper MacDonald will hurl himself at the secret documents, destroying them and himself. Well, that's the plan, the time is now 19.42 hours. I want you to get to bed, have a good night's rest and be up on parade early in the morning. Thank you for listening and thank you for a lovely supper.

Pull out to reveal that he is in a very small sitting room, alone apart from his wife who sits knitting by the fire not listening to a word he's saying.

Cut to the 'Book at Bedtime' set. Seven or eight technicians, a make-up girl. etc. still crowding around Toogood as he tries to read.

Cut to presenter at desk.

Presenter

Penguins, yes, penguins. What relevance do penguins have to the furtherance of medical science? Well, strangely enough quite a lot, a major breakthrough, maybe. It was from such an unlikely beginning as an unwanted fungus accidentally growing on a sterile plate that Sir Alexander Fleming gave the world penicillin. James Watt watched an ordinary household kettle boiling and conceived the potentiality of steam power. Would Albert Einstein ever have hit upon the theory of relativity if he hadn't been clever? All these tremendous leaps forward have been taken in the dark. Would Rutherford ever have split the atom if he hadn't tried? Could Marconi have invented the radio if he hadn't by pure chance spent years working at the problem? Are these amazing breakthroughs ever achieved except by years and years of unremitting study? Of course not. What I said earlier about accidental discoveries must have been wrong. Nevertheless scientists believe that these penguins, these comic flightless web-footed little bastards may finally unwittingly help man to fathom the uncharted depths of the human mind.

Scientist

Hello. Here at the Institute Professor Charles Pasarell, Dr Peaches Bartkowicz and myself have been working on the theory originally postulated by the late Dr Kramer that the penguin is intrinsically more intelligent than the human being.

He moves over to a large diagram which is being held by two tennis players in full tennis kit but wearing the brown coats of ordinary laboratory technicians. The diagram shows a penguin and a man in correct proportional size with their comparative brain capacities marked out clearly showing the man's to be much larger than the penguin's.

Scientist

The first thing that Dr Kramer came up with was that the penguin has a much smaller brain than the man. This postulate formed the fundamental basis of all his thinking and remained with him until his death.

Flash cut of elderly man in tennis shirt and green eye shade getting an arrow in the head. Cut back to the scientist now with diagram behind him. It shows a man and a six foot penguin.

Scientist

Now we've taken this theory one stage further. If we increase the size of the penguin until it is the same height as the man and then compare the relative brain sizes, we now find that the penguin's brain is still smaller. But, and this is the point, it is larger than it was.

These IQ tests were thought to contain an unfair cultural bias against the penguin. For example, it didn't take into account the penguins extremely poor educational system. To devise a fairer system of test, a team of our researchers spent eighteen months in Antarctica living like penguins, and subsequently dying like penguins - only quicker - proving that the penguin is a clever little sod in his own environment.

Cut to the scientist.

Therefore we devised tests to be given to the penguins in the fourth set ... I do beg your pardon, in their own environment.

Professor

What is...

Cut back to the scientist.

Scientist

The environmental barrier had been removed but we'd hit another: the language barrier. The penguins could not speak English and were therefore unable to give the answers. This problem was removed in the next series of experiments by asking the same questions to the penguins and to a random group of non-English-speaking humans in the same conditions.

First Zambesi

That's marvelous.

She can take it off at night, unless she wants to read, of course. And don't ask her too many questions because it will get hot. If you do have any trouble here is my card.

Good Bye.

First Zambesi

Thank you very much.

First Zambesi

Shall we go down and give blood?

Second Zambesi

Second Zambesi

Yes, please Mr Roosevelt, but try and keep the noise to a minimum.

First Zambesi

I'll go and get your coat for you.

They walk on passing a bus stop at which a penguin is standing reading a paper. One or two unexploded Scotsmen lie on the ground at various places.

First Zambesi

Are you sure that's working all right?

Second Zambesi

Yes, thank you dear. It's marvellous. I think if we can win one or two of the early primaries, we could split the urban Republican vote wide open.

First Zambesi

Um...here we are then.

They go into a door marked 'Blood Donors'.

Second Zambesi

Well being President of the United States is something that I shall have to think about.

They walk through and out of shot. A hospital lobby. A line of people are being ushered through. A sign says 'Blood Donors' with an arrow in the direction they're all going. Mr Samson is in a white coat.

Samson

Blood donors that way, please.

Donor

Oh thank you very much

Donor

Samson

Thank you.

Samson

Grimshaw comes up to him and whispers in his ear, Samson looks at him, slightly surprised

Samson

Grimshaw whispers again

Samson

No. There is no such thing as a urine bank.

Grimshaw

Please.

Samson

No. We have no call for it. We've quite enough of it without volunteers coming in here donating it.

Grimshaw

Just a specimen.

Samson

No, we don't want a specimen. We either want your blood or nothing.

Grimshaw

I'll give you some blood if you'll give me...

Samson

What?

Grimshaw

A thing to do some urine in.

Samson

No, no, just go away please.

Grimshaw

Anyway, I don't want to give you any blood.

Samson

Fine, well you don't have to, you see, just go away.

Grimshaw

Can I give you some spit?

Samson

No.

Grimshaw

Sweat?

Grimshaw

Earwax?

Samson

No, look, this is a blood bank - all we want is blood.

Grimshaw

All right, I'll give you some blood.

He holds out a jar full of blood.

Samson

Wher did you get that?

Grimshaw

Today. It's today's.

Samson

What group is it?

Grimshaw

What groups are there?

Samson

There's A...

Grimshaw

It's A.

Samson

sniffing the blood

Samson

Wait a moment. It's mine. This blood is mine! What are you doing with it?

Grimshaw

I found it.

Samson

You

Samson

found

Samson

it? You stole it out of my body, didn't you?

Grimshaw

No.

Samson

No wonder I'm feeling off-colour.

Samson

he starts to drink the blood; Grimshaw grabs the bottle

Samson

Give that back.

Grimshaw

It's mine.

Samson

It is not yours. You stole it.

Grimshaw

Never.

Samson

Give it back to me.

Grimshaw

All right. But only if I can give urine.

Samson

...Get in the queue.

Rickman

Good afternoon and welcome to Wife-Swapping from Redcar. And the big news this morning is that the British boy Boris Rodgers has succeeded in swapping his nine-stone Welsh-born wife for a Ford Popular and a complete set of Dickens. Well now, I can see they're ready at the start and so let's go now over for the start of the 3.30.

Cut to high shot of a street with about 10 houses on each side.

Rickman

And first let's catch up with the latest news of the betting.

SUPERIMPOSED CAPTIONS:

'NO. 12 BETTY PARKINSON

Voice Over

Number 12 Betty Parkinson 7 to 4 on favourite, number 27 Mrs Colyer 9 to 4, 5 to 1 bar those.

Rickman

And here's the starter Mrs Alec Marsh,

Rickman

she climbs onto a rostrum and fires a gun

Rickman

and they're off.

One of the doors opens and a lady rushes across the street into another house. Other doors start opening up and down the street, wiith ladies criss-crossing out of each others houses. About twenty seconds of this high activity.

Rickman

And Mrs Rodgers is the frirst to show, there she goes into Mr Johnson's, and Mrs Johnson across too Mr Colyer, followed closely by Mrs Casey on the inside. Mrs Parkinson, number 12, going well there into Mr Webster's from the Co-op, Mrs Colyer's making ground fast after a poor start, she's out of Mr Casey's into Mr Parkinson's, she's a couple og lengths ahead of Mrs Johnson who's still not out of Mr Casey's. Mrs Penguin and Mrs Colyer - these two now at the head of the field from Mrs Brown, Mrs Atkins, Mrs Parkinson, Mrs Warner and Mrs Rudd - all still at Mr Phillip's. Mrs Penguin making the running now, challenged strongly by Mrs Casey, Mars Casey coming very fast on the inside, it's going to be Mrs Casey coming from behind. Now she's making a break on the outside, Mrs Penguin running...and at the line it's Mrs Casey who's got it by a short head from Mrs Penguin in second place, Mrs Parkinson in third, Mrs Rudd, Mrs Colyer, Mrs Warner and there's Mrs Griffiths who's remained unswapped.

One lady is left in the middle of the road. Cut back to Rickman at the course railing.

Rickman

Well, a very exciting race there, and I have with me now the man who owned and trained the winner, Mrs Casey - Mr Casey. Well done, Jack.

Mr Casey

Thank you, John.

Rickman

Well, were you at all surprised about this, Jack?

Mr Casey

No, not really, no she's been going very well in training, and at Doncaster last week, and I fancy her very strongly for the Cheltenham weekend.

Rickman

Well, thank you very much indeed, Jack. We must leave you now because it's time for the team event.

Peter West type figure in a white DJ sitting at a ballroom side table. He has one or two ballroom dancers beside him.

SUPERIMPOSED TITLES: 'COME WIFE-SWAPPING - NORTH WEST V THE SOUTH EAST'

Peter

Hello, and a very warm welcome from the Tower ballroom suite at Reading, where there's very little in it, they're neck and neck, crop and grummit, real rack and saddle, brick and bucket, horse and tooth, cap and thigh, arse over tip, they're absolutely birds of a feather, there's not a new pin in it, you couldn't get a melon between them. Well, now, everything rests on the formation event and here come North West with the Mambo.

Cut to line of ballroom dancers being led out. Four gentlemen and four ladies in each team, sixteen altogether.

Peter

Maestro, take it away, please.

The dancers form up in two lines opposite each other, as though they are about to dance. The ladies are in nasty tulle, the gents in tails, with numbers on their backs. At the back of the hall a large banner says 'Mecca Wife-Swapping'. Mambo music starts its intro. After four bars the two teams starts grapping each other and wrestling on the ground. A vast orgy breaks out as they roll all over the floor. Cut quickly to Frank Bough in the 'Sportsview' studio.

Frank Bough

And now it's time for Rugby League, and highlights of this afternoon's game between Keighley and Hull Kingston Rovers.

Cut to a field where mud-caked rugby league players in hooped shirts are getting ready for a scrum.

Eddie Waring

voice over

Eddie Waring

Well, good afternoon and as you can see, Hull Kingston Rovers are well in the lead, it's a scrum down on the twenty-five, Keighley's Tom Colyer with the put in, Mrs Colyer to be put.

The scrum has formed up, the scrum half has a dummy woman, small and light, but real looking, tucked under his arm, while he steadies the scrum. He puts her into the scrum, and after a lot of kicking she is eventually heeled out.

Eddie Waring

And there goes his wife into the scrum. And Hull have got the heel against the head. Doing nicely with this scrum, some very good packing here. Warrington's picked her up, is he going to let her go, Wrigley's with him, grand lad is this.

Mrs Colyer is picked up by the scrum half who makes a run with her. Handing off a strong tackle and dodging with her, he side steps amd slips Mrs Colyer to a back who makes a run through and touches her down between the posts. They leave the lady dumped down between the posts and rush to congratulate and hug each other.

Eddie Waring

Well, that was right on the whistle, Rovers walkin' it there, winnin' easily by twenty-six points to two.

Cut to Frank Bough again in the 'Sportsview' set.

Frank Bough

Just a reminder that on 'Match of the Day' tonight you can see highlights of two of this afternoon's big games. Mrs Robinson v Manchester United and Southampton v Mr Rogers, a rather unusual game that. And here's a late result...Convetry nil, Mr Johnson's Una three - Coventry going down at home, there. Just a little reminder that the next sport you can see on BBS 1 will be 9.20 on Wednesday night, when 'Wife Swapping with Coleman' comes live from my place. Till then, goodnight.

Pull out from screen to see that this is on the screen in the awards set and Dickie is working a stirrup pump which pumps tears out from the side of his head via rather obvious tubes.

Dickie

There they go, the credits of the year. Credits that you and the Society voted as the credits that brought the most credit to the Society. Sadly, the man who designed them cannot be with us tonight, as he is at home asleep, but we are going to wake him up and tell him the good news.

We see a darkened bedroom. The light is suddenly switched on. A man sits up. He has no clothes on.

Dickie

Are you there in Bristol, Arthur Briggs...?

Briggs looks terrified. We see that another man (John) is in bed with him.

Briggs

Oh, my God!

Ladies and gentlemen will you join me and welcome please, the winners of this year's Mountbatten trophy, Showbusiness's highest accolade, the cast of the dirty Vicar sketch.

Very patriotic music. The cast of the Dirty Vicar sketch come on. They curtsy to Princess Margaret. Attenborough embraces them all.

Dickie

Well now, let us see the performances which brought them this award. Let us see the Dirty Vicar sketch.

Cut to two ladies taking tea in an Edwardian drawing room.

First Lady

Have you seen Lady Windermere's new carriage, dear?

Second Lady

Absolutely enchanting!

First Lady

Isn't it!

Chivers the butler enters.

Chivers

The new vicar to see you, m'lady.

First Lady

Send him in, Chivers.

Chivers

Certainly, m'lady.

Chivers

he goes

Enter a Swiss mountaineer (Terry G) in Tyrolean hat, lederhosen, haversack, icepick, etc. Followed by two men in evening dress. They look round and exit.

First Lady

Now, how is your tea, dear? A little more water perhaps?

Second Lady

Thank you. It is delightful as it is.

Chivers

The Reverend Ronald Simms, the Dirty Vicar of St Michael's ... ooh!

Chivers is obviously goosed from behind by the Dirty Vicar.

Vicar

Cor, what a lovely bit of stuff. I'd like to get my fingers around those knockers.

He pounces upon the second lady, throws her skirt over her head and pushes her over the back of the sofa.

First Lady

How do you find the vicarage?

The vicar stands up from behind the sofa, his shirt open and his hair awry; he reaches over and puts his hand down the first lady's front.

Vicar

I like tits!

First Lady

Oh vicar! vicar!

The vicar suddenly pulls back and looks around him as if in the horror of dawning realisation.

Vicar

Oh my goodness. I do beg your pardon. How dreadful! The first day in my new parish, I completely ... so sorry!

First Lady

adjusting her dress

First Lady

Yes. Never mind, never mind. Chivers - send Mary in with a new gown, will you?

The second lady struggles to her feet from behind the couch, completely dishevelled. Her own gown completely ripped open.

Vicar

to the second lady

Vicar

I do beg your pardon ... I must sit down.

First Lady

As I was saying, how do you find the new vicarage?

They take their seats on the couch.

Vicar

Oh yes, certainly, yes indeed, I find the grounds delightful, and the servants most attentive and particularly the little serving maid with the great big knockers, and...

He throws himself on the hostess across the tea table, knocking it over and they disappear over the back of the hostess's chair. Grunts etc. Enter Dickie applauding. Also, we hear audience applause.

Dickie

Well, there we are, another year has been too soon alas ended and I think none more than myself can be happier at this time than I ... am.

The cast of the sketch stand in a line at the back, looking awkward and smiling. Fade out.

Cut to a suburban bathroom. A plumber with a bag of tools open beside him is doing an elaborate repair on the toilet. He is in rather an awkward position.

Plumber

Plumber

struggling with the work

Plumber

come on... come on... momentous ascent, the brothers took one last look at their craft, as it stood on the field of Annencay.

Pleasant elegant eighteenth-century music. Mix to a French small country-house interior. At the window Joseph and Jacques Montgolfier are looking out at their balloon. In the background a plumber is working away at a bit of eighteenth-century French piping.

Jacques

This is a great moment for us, Joseph.

Joseph

It is a great moment for France.

Jacques

Ah, oui!

Joseph

First ascent in a hot-air balloon, by the Montgolfier brothers - 1783 ... I can see us now... just after Montesquieu and just before Mozart.

Jacques

I think I'll go and wash ...

Joseph

Good luck.

Jacques

Oh ... it's quite easy, really ... I just slap a little water on my face, then...

Joseph

No... good luck for tomorrow.

Jacques

Oh I see, yes. You too. Yours has been the work.

Joseph

Let us hope for a safe ascent... and don't use my flannel.

Jacques

You know, when you showed me the plans in Paris, I could not believe that we should be the first men who would fly.

Joseph

Yes ... it's wonderful.

Jacques

I am so excited I could hardly wash.

Joseph

Yes ... I too have had some difficulty washing these past few days.

Jacques

Still, what is washing when we are on the verge of a great scientific breakthrough?

Joseph

Jacques...

Jacques

Yes, Joseph...

Joseph

I have not been washing very thoroughly for many years now.

Jacques

What do you mean? You must have been washing your face?

Joseph

Oh yes, my face, I wash my face... but my legs... my stomach ... my chest, they're filthy.

Jacques

Well, I don't wash my stomach every day.

Joseph

with increasing self-remorse

Joseph

Ah, but you wash far more than me ... you are the cleaner of the Montgolfier brothers.

Jacques

This is nothing, Joseph...

A very formal butler enters.

Butler

Monsieur Montgolfier.. A Mr Parfitt to see you, sir.

A head appears round the door and corrects the butler, in a very stage whisper.

Mr Bartlett

No, no... no... Bartlett!

Mr Bartlett

the head disappears again

Butler

A Mr Barklit, to see you, sir.

Mr Bartlett

No! Bartlett with a 't'.

Joseph

I don't want to see anyone, O'Toole... tell him to go away.

Butler

Thank you, sir.

Butler

he exits

Jacques

Well, it's getting late. I must go and have a wash.

Joseph

What will you be washing?

Jacques

Oh ... just my face and neck ... perhaps my feet... and possibly ... but no ... no ... lock up the plans, Joseph... tomorrow they will make us the toast of France. 'The first ascent by the Montgolfier brothers in a balloon'. Just after Ballcock and just before Bang... what a position!

Some men have now entered the room, chosen a spot and are briskly but quietly setting up a screen and a projector, The projector is turned on and a film comes up on the screen together with triumphant music, applause and commentary. We zoom in to the screen. It shows an animation of two naked men boxing in a large tub of water.

Voice Over

So, on June 7th, 1783, the Montgolfier brothers had a really good wash ... starting on his face and arms, Joseph Michael Montgolfier went on to scrub his torso, his legs and his naughty bits, before rinsing his whole body. That June night, he and his brother between them washed seventeen square feet of body area. They used a kilo and a half of catholic soap and nearly fourteen gallons of nice hot water. It was indeed an impressive sight.

Music crescendo.

Voice Over

Next week on 'The Golden Age of Ballooning', we examine the work of Girlsher and Coxwell, the English balloonists who ascended to a height of seven miles in 1862 without washing. There is also a book called 'The Golden Age of Ballooning' published by the BBC to coincide with the series. It's in an attractive hand-tooled binding, is priced £5 and failure to buy it will make you liable to a £50 fine or three months' imprisonment. There's also a record of someone reading the book of 'The Golden Age of Ballooning', a crochet-work bedspread with the words 'The Golden Age of Ballooning' on it, available from the BBC, price £18 or five months' imprisonment and there are matching toilet-seat covers and courtesy mats with illustrations of many of the baboons mentioned. Also available is a life-size model frog which croaks the words 'The Golden Age of Ballooning' and an attractive bakelite case for storing motorway construction plans in, made in the shape of a balloon. And now, another chance to see a repeat of this morning's re-run of last night's second showing of episode two of the award-winning series 'The Golden Age of Ballooning'.

CAPTION: 'NOT WITH EACH OTHER, OBVIOUSLY'

Joseph Montgolfier's workshop. We see plans and drawing boards, and at one end of the room, Joseph's fiancee, Antoinette, in a pretty dress. She is hanging suspended in a harness horizontally, attached to a gas bag. In other words she is fioating like the bottom half of an airship. Joseph is making calculations excitedly. Occasionally he goes over to her, takes a measurement and goes back to his desk to write it down.

Antoinette

Oh Joseph, all you think about is balloons... all you talk about is balloons. Your beautiful house is full of bits and pieces of balloons... your books are all about balloons... every time you sing a song, it is in some way obliquely connected with balloons... everything you eat has to have 'balloon' incorporated in the title... your dogs are an called 'balloonno'... you tie balloons to your ankles in the evenings.

Joseph

I don't do that!

Antoinette

Well, no, you don't do that, but you do duck down and shout 'Hey! Balloons!' when there are none about. Your whole life is becoming obsessively balloonic, you know. Why do I have to hang from this bloody gas bag all day? Don't I mean anything to you?

Joseph

busy measuring

Joseph

Oh ma cherie, you mean more to me than any heavier than air dirigible could ever...

Antoinette

Oh there you go again!

Joseph

Don't waggle!

Jacques enters.

Jacques

I've run your bath for you, Joseph.

Jacques

he sees Antoinette

Jacques

Oh... I'm so sorry, I didn't realize.

Joseph

It's all right, we've done the difficult bit.

Jacques

Well, don't forget we have our special guest coming this evening.

Joseph

Oh?

Jacques

Don't tell me you have forgotten already. The man who is giving us thousands of francs for our experiments.

Joseph

What man?

Jacques

Louis XIV!

Joseph

Isn't he dead?

Jacques

Evidently not...

Joseph

All right, I'll be round.

Jacques

Oh, and Joseph...

Joseph

Yes, Jacques?

Jacques

You will... wash... won't you?

Joseph

Yes, of course!

CAPTION: 'LATER THAT EVENING'

Fade up on the Montgolfiers' sitting room. Jacques sits there rather nervously. The plumber is working away. The door opens and the butler appears.

Butler

His Royal Majesty, Louis XIV of France.

Mr Bartlett's head pops in and whispers loudly to butler.

Mr Bartlett

And Mr Bartlett.

The butler pushes him aside. Fanfare. Enter Louis XIV and two tough-looking advisers. He is resplendent in state robes.

Jacques

Your Majesty. It's a great privilege. Welcome to our humble abode.

Louis

in very broad Glaswegian accent

Louis

It's er... very nice to be here.

Jacques

calling

Jacques

O'Toole.

Butler

Sir?

Jacques

Claret for His Majesty please.

Butler

There's a Mr Barttett outside again, sir.

Jacques

Not now, I can't see him, we have the King of France here.

Butler

Yes, sir.

He exits. Jacques and the king stand in rather embarrassed silence. Jacques eventually speaks.

Jacques

Your Majesty. You had a pleasant journey, I trust?

Louis

Yes... yes, oh definitely... yes... yes. Oh aye, aye.

Silence.

Jacques

You have come from Paris?

Louis

Where?

Jacques

From Paris... you have travelled from Paris?

Louis

Oh yes, we've come from Paris... yes... yes, yes, we've just come from... er... Paris... yes.

The butler comes back in.

Jacques

Yes, O'Toole?

Butler

Which one is the claret, sir?

Jacques

The claret is in the decanter.

Butler

The wooden thing?

Jacques

No no... the glass thing... the glass decanter with the round glass stopper.

Butler

Oh yes, behind the door.

Jacques

No no... on the sideboard.

Butler

The sideboard?

Jacques

The sideboard... yes. Look... you go into the salle à manger ... the

Jacques

dining room

Jacques

, right? - and the sideboard is on your left, by the wall, beside the master's portrait.

Butler

Ah! Above the mirror, sir?

Jacques

No! No! The mirror is on the other side. It's

Jacques

opposite

Jacques

the mirror.

Butler

But that's the

Butler

table

Butler

, sir.

Jacques

No... you don't go as

Jacques

far

Jacques

as the table. You go into the room, right?... on your right is the door to the orangery, straight ahead of you is the door to the library, and to your left is the sideboard.

Butler

Ah, yes, I see, sir...

Jacques

And the claret is on top of the sideboard, to the left.

Butler

On the left.

Jacques

Yes...

Butler

As one looks at it, sir?

Jacques

Yes.

Butler

I see, sir, thank you.

Butler

he turns to go

Jacques

Will you please tell Monsieur Joseph our guest is here.

He leaves. There is another embarrassed silence.

Jacques

I'm sorry about that, Your Majesty.

Butler

re-entering

Butler

Apparently, sir, there is a plan to build a canal between the two Egyptian towns of..,

Jacques

Not now, O'Toole!

The butler exits. More silence.

Louis

Well... er... Mr Montgolfier... let's not beat around the bush ... my... dukes and I are very busy men. What we'd like to do is see the plans of your proposed balloon... if that's at all possible.

Jacques

Certainly, Your Majesty... I have them here ready prepared.

Louis

Oh, great .... then... what we would like to do ... is er... to take them back with us for the Royal Archives of er...

First Duke

also Glaswegian

First Duke

France.

Louis

France, aye.

Jacques

Well, it is indeed a great honour Your Majesty, that I cannot refuse.

Louis

Right! OK! Let's get 'em.

He and his two dukes are suddenly galvanized into action. They are about to grab the plans when Joseph enters, clad only in a towel and rather silly bath hat.

Joseph

Just a moment!

Jacques

Joseph!

Joseph

indicating the king

Joseph

This man is not Louis XIV!

Jacques

Joseph! Are you out of your mind!

Joseph

I've been looking it up in my bath. Louis XIV died in 1717. It's now 1783! Answer me that!

Louis

Did I say Louis XIV? Oh, sorry, I meant Louis XV... Louis XV.

Joseph

He

Joseph

died in 1774!

Louis, getting rather hot and angry, comes over to Joseph belligerently.

Louis

All right, Louis

Louis

XVI

Louis

!... listen to me, smartarse, when you're King of France,... you've got better things to do than go around all day remembering your bloody number.

Putting his face very close to Joseph's. He butts him sharply and viciously on the bridge of the nose with his forehead in the time-honoured Glaswegian way.

Joseph

Aaaaaarh!

He reels away, clutching his nose in agony. Louis approaches Jacques, equally belligerently.

Louis

Right! You want to argue about numbers?

Jacques

Er... no, no.

Louis

Right, well... lets get hold of the plans for the Royal Archives. We've got to get back to... er...

First Duke

Paris.

Louis

Paris by tonight so get a move on..

Joseph

Aaaargh! Ow! Ooooohh!

The butler reappears.

Butler

I got as far as the sideboard, sir...

Louis and his dukes grab the plans and push past the butler and across to an open window. There is a bit of a scuffle at the window as they are clambering out at the same time as two men in black with a projector and screen are clambering in.

Joseph

Stop them... oh! Ah... oooooohh!

Butler

to Jacques

Butler

No news on the canal I'm afraid, sir, but apparently in India they're thinking of building a railway between the towns of Lahore...

Joseph

Stop... ow! Stop them, O'Toole for... oh! shit! God's sake... stop them, they've got the plans!

Joseph

he rushes to the window

By now the men in black have set up the screen. On the screen comes film of Louis and his men racing through the gardens away from the Montgolfier' s home.

Oh yes... I agree that the army should take over, but I think it should not interfere with the programme of street executions, which I feel have been the shot in the arm that the British economy so desperately needed.

As they drone on, the presenter turns away from them to talk softly into the camera.

Presenter

The Montgolfier brothers' plans did indeed turn up... six months later, and a long way from Paris, at the court of King George III of England.

Cut to a throne room. George III is being read to by an adviser.

CAPTION: 'THE COURT OF GEORGE III, 1781'

Reader

... Titty was very worried. Where could Mary be? He looked everywhere. Under the stones and behind the bushes... and Mr Squirrel helped him by looking up in the trees, and Mr Badger helped him by looking under the ground...

There is a knock on the door. George III looks up quickly. The reader, with obvoiously well practiced skill, shuts the book, slips it beneath another book which he opens and carries on reading.

Reader

... and so, Your Majesty, we the Commons do herein crave and beseech that...

George III

Enter!

Lord North enters and bows briefly.

Lord North

Your Majesty... Louis XVIII is here!

George III

Who is Louis XVIII?

Lord North

The King of France, Your Majesty! This is a great moment to have, sir.

George III

There is no Louis XVIII.

We hear a Scottish voice outside the door. Lord North ducks his head out for a moment, then reappears.

Lord North

He craves Your Majesty's pardon. He has had a long journey here and miscounted... He is Louis XVII.

George III

Louis XVI is dead already?

A trace of worry crosses North's face. He goes outside the door again for a moment. Sounds of a slight argument between himself and the Glaswegians. Suddenly there is a yell of pain and Lord North reels in holding the bridge of his nose.

Lord North

Aaaaaaaaaaaaghh! Oh my God! Oh... ah... oh Christ!

Louis strides in with the two dukes. They all wear tam o'shanters.

Louis

to the reader

Louis

to George III

Louis

Your Majesty... I am Louis XVI as you so rightly say, and I don't want to muck about. I have a wee proposition which could make the name of George IV the most respected in Europe...

George III

George

George III

III

Louis

George III! Sorry. Where can we talk?

Lord North

Oh! God! ... did you see that?... Oh!... aaaargh! Oh dear!

Lord North

he is in great pain still and clutching his nose

George III

We shall have a state banquet at St James' Palace!

Louis

No no, look, I can't hang about. It's take it or leave... we got to get back to... er...

First Duke

Paris.

Louis

Paris, by tonight...

George III

Must you leave us, Louis?

Louis

I'd rather just sell the plans and nip off, Georgie boy.

George III

All right... we will buy the plans... if you will undertake to disengage your troops in America.

Louis

Do what?

George III

And, I shall give you £10,000 for the plans...

Louis

Ten thousand

Louis

pounds

Louis

! Right, well, we'll disengage the, urn, you know... like you said - we'll disengage 'em... tell you what, then, I'll put a duke on to it... OK? Right!

Lord North

still clutching his nose

Lord North

That's the worst thing you can do to anybody.

Louis

You asked for it, sonny.

Lord North

You could have broken my bloody nose!

George III

North! Please!

Lord North

You saw it! It was right on the bone.

George III

North! Will you send for the Duke of Portland ... we have a financial matter to discuss.

Lord North

Well, it really hurt.

Louis

No, look, I think it's better if you give the money to us. We're going back. We've got a bag.

George III

No, no... don't worry, Louis. We shall talk to your Monsieur Necker.

Louis

Ah! Well, actually, we'd rather you didn't... we've been having a wee bit of trouble with him... you know what I mean?

George III

Monsieur Necker? The man who introduced so many valuable reforms and who proved so popular despite his opposition to Mirabeau's policy of issuing 'assignats'?

SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'THIS SPEECH HAS BEEN VERIFIED BY ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA'

Louis

Er... aye, yeah... the trouble is he's been drinking a bit recently ... you' know, fourteen lagers with his breakfast... that sort of thing.

George III

Well... very well, Louis...

The door flies open and there is Joseph Montgolfier, still clad only in towel and silly bath hat.

Joseph

Just a moment!

Louis

Oh, Christ!

George III

What are you doing?

Joseph

I am Joseph Montgolfier, the inventor of the fire balloon. The man before you is an impostor!

George III

Ooh! I am not ... honestly!

Joseph

No, not you, Your Majesty

Joseph

he points at Louis

Joseph

This man - this Louis, the so-called King of France man. Which number did you give this time - Louis the 23rd?

Louis

I got it right!

Joseph

I bet you took a few guesses.

Louis

Listen, you spotty sassenach pillock..

Dr Hamer

not a doctor but a period butler

Dr Hamer

Your Majesty! The Ronettes are here.

Bartlett

And Mr Bartlett.

Three black ladies wearing modern showbiz costumes come in and sing 'George III' song. Two men come in and set up a screen as before.

The Ronettes

singing

The Ronettes

George III ... etc .... etc ....

George III

Oh dear, I'm not supposed to go mad till 1800!

Louis, arguing violently with the butler, butts him. Music comes up and the sound fades on this strange scene. George III falls to the floor and waggles his legs around in the air. Zoom in as the men in black take cover off the caption.

CAPTION: 'MEANWHILE, IN FRANCE...'

Cut to drawing more in the Montgolfiers' house. Jacques is at a table working on some drawings. Behind him Antoinette paces the room nervously. She is still wearing her harness, but it is no longer attached to the gas balloon. In a corner of the room a plumber is still mending the elaborate plumbing.

Antoinette

Joseph has been gone for six months now ... we have heard nothing!

Jacques

He can look after himself.

Antoinette

But he had only on a towel, you know.

Jacques takes off his false ears and walks over to Antoinette.

Jacques

Antoinette... from now on there is only one Montgolfier brother.

Antoinette

But Louis XIV has the plans... you must wait until Joseph returns.

Jacques

casually loosening her harness

Jacques

he indicates the desk where he has been working

Jacques

Let me put my tongue in your mouth.

Antoinette

What do you mean?

Jacques

We're supposed to be French, aren't we?

Antoinette

No, I mean what are the plans which Joseph after is chasing?

Jacques

Please, let me put it in a little way.

Antoinette

Oh, Jacques, ze

Antoinette

plans

Antoinette

!

Jacques

I take it out if you don't like it.

He chases her a bit with his tongue out. Antoinette is about to react rather violently one way or the other, when her dramatic moment is cut short by the entrance of O'Toole the butler.

Butler

Are you sure the claret was on the left of the sideboard, sir?

Jacques

Yes, O'Toole, it's always been there.

Butler

Well I'll look for one more month, sir.

Butler

he turns and goes out; Jacques eyes Antoinette lasciviously and is about to try and make contact in the French way when the butler returns

Butler

By the way sir, Mr Bartlett has gone, sir. He said he couldn't wait any longer.

Jacques

Thank you, O'Toole...

Butler

Not at all, sir... I've enjoyed being in it...

Jacques

impatiently

Jacques

Right!

Butler

Thank you, sir... mam'selle.

He exits. Tremendous applause. He reappears, takes a bow and leaves again. Jacques and Antoinette look nonplussed. He reappears. Terrific applause. He gestures for them to quiet down. Eventually them is silence.

Butler

By the way, sir, Mr Bartlett has gone, sir.

Butler

tremendous applause

Butler

He said he couldn't wait any longer, sir.

Incredible volume of laughter here brings the house down. The rest of the scene is pandemonium with laughter developing into prolonged applause.

Jacques

Thank you, O'Toole.

Butler

Not at all, sir ... I've enjoyed being in it.

Butler

Thank you, sir ... mam'selle.

Audience

More! More! More! etc .... etc .... etc ....

Crescendo of applause. Over shouts of more! More! Superimposed Python credits. The butler is showered with flowers. Fans come on and congratulate him. A BBC security man restrains them. Other members of the cast appear and shake hands, and stand in a row behind, applauding. A dear old middle-aged lady comes in and stands beside him, weeping proudly.

Ferdinand von Zeppelin was born in Constance in 1838, the brother of Barry Zeppelin, the least talented of the fourteen Zeppelin brothers.

Black and white film of Barry (Terry J) blowing up balloons of increasing size. They all sink to the ground. The last one blows back and inflates him; he rises into the air. Cut to stock film of a zeppelin.

Voice Over

Meanwhile for Ferdinand von Zeppelin, the year 1908 was a year of triumph.

Cut to interior of a zeppelin. A party. Expensively dressed guests. Champagne. A palm court orchestra playing. Some guests looking out of the windows in wonderment.

Von Bülow

Von Bülow

Herr Zeppelin - it's wonderful! It's put ballooning right back on the map.

Zeppelin goes instantly berserk with anger.

Zeppelin

It's not a

Zeppelin

... an airship ... d'you hear?

He hits him very hard on the top of the head with the underside of his fist.

Von Bülow

Well, it's very nice anyway.

Tirpitz

to Zeppelin

Tirpitz

Tell me, what is the principle of these balloons?

Zeppelin

It's not a balloon! You stupid little thick-headed Saxon git! It's not a balloon! Balloons is for kiddy-winkies. If you want to play with balloons, get outside.

Drags Tirpitz over to the door, opens it and flings him out into the clouds.

Tirpitz

Aaaaaaaaaghhh!

Cut to an old German couple in a cottage. The man is reading from a big book, the lady is knitting. The man is in underpants. There are a pair of lederhosen drying in front of the fire.

Hollweg

I hear you are to name the balloon after Bismarck?

Zeppelin

flying into hysterical rage

Zeppelin

Bismarck? Of course I'm not calling it after Bismarck. It's a zeppelin. It's nothing to do with bloody Bismarck!

Hollweg

Surely he gave you some money for it?

Zeppelin

Get outside!

He opens the door and flings Hollweg out. Cut back to the old couple in the cottage.

Helmut

Za... bag... lione... a sort of cream mouse... mousse of Italian origin...

Roof splintering noise. A thump and the house shakes. Cut back to the airship. A little cluster of people round the door. The party is still going on but there is a little tension in the atmosphere.

Von Bülow

Ferdinand... that was a Minister of State you just threw out of the balloon.

Zeppelin

It's not a balloon! It's an airship!

Von Bülow

All right, I'm sorry.

All right - go and have a look!

Oh, look! It's the Chancellor!

Ja!

No - he

Helmut

Well...

Mrs Helmut

Look!

She opens the door wider to reveal heap of about ten bodies in the other room. There is dust rising from them and a big hole in the ceiling. Helmut goes to the door.

Helmut

Which one is Von Bülow?

They walk round the pile. Mrs Helmut looks at a few bodies and then points.

Mrs Helmut

Here ... look!

Helmut

Oh, ja ... and Admiral Tirpitz!

They are both momentarily overawed.

Mrs Helmut

Ja.

Helmut

And Von Müller... and Herr Reichner... and Hollweg and Von Graunberg...

What shall we do, Helmut?

We must ring the Government.

Mrs Helmut

Ja, well...

Helmut

There are no members of the Government dead in our sitting room.

Mrs Helmut

Ja, you know what I mean.

Helmut

Perhaps I should make a little speech or something?

Mrs Helmut

Not a speech, Helmut no...

Helmut

Shall we make them a cup of tea?

Mrs Helmut

It would be a waste of tea.

Helmut

But we must do something - so many important people in our drawing room - we must do

Helmut

something

Helmut

They think for a little while.

Mrs Helmut

We could sort them out.

Helmut

And make a little list.

Mrs Helmut

Ja, ja. We could put the ministers for internal affairs over against the wall, and those for foreign here by the clock.

Helmut

And we can sort them out alphabetically?

Mrs Helmut

Nein, nein - just put the cleanest by the door.

Helmut

Ja.

They start to hump the corpses around. Helmut starts to hump Von Bülow towards the clock.

Mrs Helmut

No, no! That's Von Bülow! He must go over here.

Helmut

That is my reading chair.

Mrs Helmut

He is the Reich Chancellor of Germany, Helmut.

Helmut starts to take him towards the reading chair.

Helmut

All right ... but I think he would have been better up against the clock, you know.

Mrs Helmut

No, he would not look nice under the clock.

Helmut

I did not say

Helmut

under

Helmut

against

Helmut

the clock.

Mrs Helmut

Well then we could not see the clock!

Helmut

We could put the Minister for Colonies under the clock. He's small.

Mrs Helmut

No. Colonies are

Helmut lifts up the head of another corpse

Mrs Helmut

Education!

Helmut starts to drag him over to the wall.

Helmut

Soon we shall be able to make a list.

Mrs Helmut

Ja, ja, wait a minute! ... Who's that by the cat litter?

Helmut

I don't know. I've never seen him before.

Mrs Helmut

He is not a member of the Government. Get him out of here. Put him in the drawing room.

Helmut

He's

Mrs Helmut

Ja, well you know what I mean.

Put him in the sitting room.

Establishing shot of large Harrods-type store. Outside limousines and taxis are disgorging very rich customers. Small doormen in enormously large coats opening door of cars. A man with his nose bandaged comes out of the store. One large car pulls softly up to the curb, and as small doorman (Michael) opens its door, an enormously opulent lady (Terry J) in furs gets out. The doorman holds the door open. She knees him in the groin and walks on into the store. Chris Quinn (Eric) arrives on a bicycle. He parks the bicycle against the curb (the doorman flings it into the road) and goes into the outer hall of the store. He passes a couple leaving who also have noses bandaged. A gaggle of customers, mostly pepperpots, rush out. A very eager pepperpot lady shopper, going the other way, rushes between the two and bangs into a set of glass doors which have closed behind the gaggle. She cries out with pain clutching her nose and is escorted away by a large, coated attendant. Chris Quinn looks up at the list on the wall. It reads:

BASEMENT: DANGEROUS GASES, VIRUSES, CONTAGIOUS DISEASES, RESTAURANT AND TOILET FIXINGS.

GROUND FLOOR: MENSWEAR, BOYSWEAR, EFFEMINATE GOODS HALL, ILL HEALTH FOODS.

Quinn, knowing that there are doors, goes forward more cautiously and enters. The banging of noses on glass doors is a constant background theme. Cut to the gift department. A large lady is standing by counter holding a large cylinder with a rose attachment.

Lady

Yes this looks the sort of thing. May I just try it?

Assistant

Certainly, madam.

The lady presses button and a sheet of flame shoots out across the hall.

Lady

Oh! Sorry!

Lady

So

Lady

she is happy though

Lady

Yes that's fine.

Assistant

Is that on account, madam?

Lady

Yes.

Chris walks by, watching with interest but not much concern, passing a customer whose back is on fire but who has not noticed. He approaches a counter with a sign saying 'Ant Counter'. He stands by the apparently empty counter for one moment, then rings a bell.

Chris

Hello? Hello?

A strange rubber-masked head appears from below the other side of the counter and gesticulates at him making a strange noise. This soon stops.

First Assistant

Oh, I'm terribly sorry...

First Assistant

he takes off the mask to reveal a straight forward assistant

First Assistant

I thought you were someone else.

Chris

Oh I see, yes.

First Assistant

I'm sorry sir, can I help you?

Chris

Yes, yes, as a matter of fact you can, actually I was interested in the possibility... of purchasing one of your ... can I ask who you thought I was?

First Assistant

What?

Chris

Who did you think I was... just then... when you thought I was somebody.

First Assistant

Oh, it's no one you'd know, sir.

Chris

Well I might know them.

First Assistant

It's possible, obviously, but I think it's really unlikely.

Chris

Well, I know quite a lot...

First Assistant

I mean he's hardly likely to move in your circles, sir...

Chris

Why, is he very

Chris

rich

Chris

?

First Assistant

Oh, no, I didn't mean that, sir.

Chris

Is he a lord or something?

First Assistant

Oh, no, not at all.

Chris

Well look, this is very easy to settle. What is his name?.

Chris

What is his name?

First Assistant

Well... er...

Chris

Yes?

First Assistant

Michael Ellis.

Chris

Who?

Chris

I see.

First Assistant

Do you know him, sir?

Chris

Er ... Michael Ellis. Michael Ellis...

First Assistant

You don't

Chris

Well, I don't remember the name.

First Assistant

I think you would remember him, sir.

Chris

Why do you say that?

First Assistant

Well, would you remember a man six foot nine inches high, fortyish, and he's got a long scar from here to here and absolutely no nose?

Chris

... oh, I think I do remember somebody like that...

First Assistant

Well, that's not Michael Ellis.

Chris

What?

First Assistant

He's a small man about this high with a high-pitched voice.

Chris

Right, I'm not going to buy an ant from you now.

First Assistant

distressed

First Assistant

Oh, no, please.

Chris

No. You've not been properly trained. I demand another assistant.

Oh, no, come on... please...

Chris

No, I want

First Assistant

All right! I'll get another assistant.

First Assistant

Oh no, please please please let me help you...

Chris

No! I want another assistant.

First Assistant

Oh, no, come on, please...

Chris

If you don't give me another assistant...

First Assistant

No, no, I'll be very good, sir, really.

First Assistant

he becomes exaggeratedly polite

First Assistant

Good morning, sir... how are you, sir... bit parky outside today... isn't it, sir... ? A very nice suit you've got there, sir... you had a very close shave this morning, sir...

Chris

Right I'm going!

First Assistant

No, no, please...

First Assistant

he takes off his moustache

First Assistant

he rings the bell on the counter.

After a pause, very slowly indeed an identical mask to the first appears over the top of the counter right next to the first assistant, making the same noise very quietly. The first assistant sees him, starts and nudges him hard.

Second Assistant

Woooooo ....ooooooo...

First Assistant

It's not him!

The second assistant makes a disappointed noise and disappears below.

No!

Second Assistant

appearing from below counter without a mask, looking immaculate

Second Assistant

Yes, sir, can I be of any assistance?

Chris

Oh no, come on, don't try that!

Second Assistant

I'm sorry, sir... try what?

Chris

You know perfectly well what I mean.

Second Assistant

I'm afraid I don't, sir.

Chris

You were down behind there with a silly mask on going wooo-ooo...

Second Assistant

I don't think I was, sir.

Chris

All right, get the manager.

Second Assistant

There seems to have been some sort of misunderstanding, sir.

Chris

Manager!

First Assistant

This is the manager, sir.

Second Assistant

in a silly voice

Second Assistant

Yes, I'm the manager.

Chris

he keeps calling

Second Assistant

It's a smashing store this, I can't recommend it too highly, well-lit, rat-free. It's a joy to manage. Oh yes, the freshest haddock in London, second floor, third floor Ribena, ants here, television and flame throwers over there, behind them our dinner-wagon exhibition closes at six...

First Assistant

nudging him

First Assistant

Quick!

They both disappear under the counter. The real manager arrives and presents himself to Chris.

Real Manager

Yes, sir? Can I help you, sir?

Chris

noticing the 'manager' badge on his lapel

Chris

Yes, I want to complain about the assistants on this counter.

Real Manager

I'm sorry to hear that, sir, which ones?

Chris

Well, they're hiding now.

Real Manager

Sir?

Chris

They're hiding, down there behind the counter.

Real Manager

I see, sir.

Real Manager

he goes round counter, looks, but obviously can't see them; Chris goes round to join in the search

Real Manager

... well... there's nobody down here, sir.

Chris

They must have crawled through here, and made their escape through 'Soft Toys'.

Chris

he points

Real Manager

Yes, of course.

Chris

They were wearing masks and making silly noises and one of them pretended to be the manager. He spoke like this..

Chris

he does an impression

Real Manager

Ah! I think I've got it, sir, I think I've got it! It's rag week.

Chris

Ragweek?

Real Manager

Yes, you know, for charity, sir.

Chris

Oh! I see. Some local college or university?

No, no it's the

Real Manager

Yes. The senior staff don't join in much - it's for the trainees really...

Chris

It's not very good for business is it?

Real Manager

Oh, It's for charity, sir. People are awfully good about it, you know.

Real Manager

he rattles a collecting tin

Chris

Yes, yes, of course.

Chris

he puts a coin in

Real Manager

Right, sir, I'll get you a senior assistant - ants, was it?

Chris

Yes, please.

Real Manager

calling

Real Manager

Mr Snetterton approaches immediately; he is clearly the first assistant with very bad short crew-cut wig on

Real Manager

Could you look after this gentleman, Mr Snetterton?

Chris

I don't want him!

First Assistant

Oh

First Assistant

please!

First Assistant

Give me a chance!

Real Manager

All right - Mr Hartford!

Hartford

Yes - good morning, sir - can I help you?

Chris

Yes, please, I'm interested in buying an ant.

Hartford

Ah yes - and what price were you thinking of paying, sir?

Chris

Oh, well, I hadn't actually got as far as that.

Hartford

Well sir, they start about half a p. but they can go as high as three p. or even three and a half p. for a champion - inflation I'm afraid...

Chris

Well, I should think one about one and a half p., please.

Hartford

Ah yes, well you should get a very serviceable little animal for that, sir. Quite frankly the half pence ones are a bit on the mangy side ... What length was sir thinking of?

Chris

Oh ... medium?

Hartford

Medium. Medium. Here we are, sir.

Hartford

he tips some ants - which we can't see - out into a special ring on counter

Hartford

That one there is an Ayrshire, and that one there is a King George bitch I think ... and that one killing the little flitbat is an Afghan.

Chris

That's a nice one.

Hartford

Let's see how you get on with him, eh?

Hartford

he puts it on Chris's hand

Hartford

Ah yes, he likes you. He's taken to you.

Chris

What do you feed them on?

Hartford

Blancmange.

Chris

Blancmange?

Hartford

I'm sorry. I don't know why I said that. No, you don't feed them at all.

Chris

Well, what do they live on?

Hartford

They don't. They die.

Chris

They die?

Hartford

Well of course they do, if you don't feed them.

Chris

I don't understand.

Hartford

You let them die, then you buy another one. It's much cheaper than feeding them and that way you have a constant variety of little companions.

Chris

Oh, I see.

Hartford

That's the advantage of owning an ant.

Chris

Right, well I'll take this one. Oh dear, I've dropped it...

Hartford

Never mind. Here's another one.

Chris

Is there anything else I'll need?

Hartford

Yes, sir - you'll need an ant house.

Hartford

he produces a birdcage

Hartford

This is the model we recommend, sir.

Chris

Won't it get out of there?

Hartford

Yes.

Chris

Well what's the point of having the cage?

Hartford

Well, none at all really. And then some pieces of cage furniture which will keep him entertained.

Hartford

he produces microscopic things

Hartford

Here's an ant-wheel, ant-swing, and a very nice one here, a little ladder - he can run up there and ring the bell at the top, that's a little trick he can learn.

Chris

Will he live long enough?

Hartford

Not really, no, but it's best to have one just in case, and here's a two-way radio he can play with... and of course you'll need the book.

Hartford

he produces an expensive-looking book, thoughtlessly slams it down where the ants were, then hurriedly brushes them away

Chris

The book?

Hartford

Yes, the book on ants.

Chris

looking unsure

Chris

Yes...

Hartford

So, sir, that is, if I may say so, one hundred and eighty-four pounds one and a half p., sir.

Chris

Will you take a cheque?

Hartford

Yes, sir, if you don't mind leaving a blood-sample, and a piece of skin off the back of the scalp just here, sir ...

Hartford

indicates a point behind his ear

Hartford

he hands him a little knife and some cotton wool

Chris

Oh, well I think I'll put it on account.

Hartford

I should, sir... much less painful. Anyway sir, you know what they say about an ant. A friend for life, eh? Well, a friend for its life anyway...

Hartford

Hartford loads the large cage, furniture, two-way radio and the book on ants into a huge box; with some difficulty he finds the ant; he picks it up carefully

Hartford

he drops him in the big box and pushes it across the counter; the box has on one side, in large letters 'live ant: handle with care'; it has breathing holes in it

Hartford

If the little chap should go to an early grave, sir, give us a ring and we'll stick a few in an envelope, all right?

Chris

Thanks very much indeed.

Hartford

Not at all, thank

Hartford

you

Hartford

, Mr Ellis.

Chris turns sharply. The first assistant comes quickly up to Hartford.

First Assistant

Sssssshh!

Chris

What did you say?

Hartford

I said thank you, Mr Ellis...

First Assistant

It's not him.

Hartford

Oh!

Chris

Why did you say I was Mr Ellis?

Hartford

innocently

Hartford

Who?

First Assistant

No, he didn't say that.

Chris

Yes he did. I heard him say 'Thank you, Mr Ellis'.

First Assistant

Oh, no, no - he said 'I'm jealous'.

First Assistant

I'm jealous of your ant. Goodbye. Goodbye.

First Assistant

waves pointedly

Chris

leaving the counter

Chris

I don't care who Michael Ellis is!

Chris passes a shop area labelled 'The Paisley Counter' where two customers are talking to mirrors in thick Irish accents. Chris moves on to lift. A little old lady passes, oblivious to the fact that her shopping trolley is smouldering. The lady passes and Chris is about to enter.

PA System

Will Mr Michael Ellis please go straight to the manager's office... I'll repeat that...

PA System

Chris wheels round and listens

PA System

Will Mr Nigel Mellish please go straight to the manager's office.

Chris narrows his eyes suspiciously and gets into the lift cautiously. Cut to the kitchen in Chris Quinn's home. His mother is putting chopped meat into a line af at least half a dozen feeding bowls with various animal names on them. 'Babboon', 'Dromedary', 'Gorilla', 'Trout', and 'Pangolin'. There is a tiger in a cage in the middle of the kitchen, with a bowl marked 'Tiger' in front of him. A large cobra is hanging from the clothes drier and a wolf is in a cage below the sink. A monkey is on top of one of the cupboards. Chris enters with the box.

Mother

What have you got now?

Chris

I bought an ant, mother.

Mother

What d'you want one of them for! I'm not going to clean it out. You said you'd clean the tiger out, but do you? No, I suppose you've lost interest in it now. Now it'll be ant ant ant for a couple of days, then all of a sudden, 'oh, mum, I've bought a sloth' or some other odd-toed ungulate like a tapir.

Chris

It's really different this time, mum. I'm really going to look after this ant.

Mother

That's what you said about the sperm whale... now your papa's having to use it as a garage.

Chris

Well, you didn't feed it properly.

Mother

Where are we going to get forty-four tons of plankton from every morning? Your papa was dead vexed about that. They thought he was mad in the deli.

Chris

Well at least he's got a free garage.

Chris

growl from the tiger

Mother

That's no good to him... his Hillman smells all fishy.

Mother

we hear a roar

Mother

Oh blimey, that's the tiger. He'll want his mandies.

Chris

Are you giving that tiger drugs?

Mother

'

Mother

Course

Mother

I'm giving it drugs!

Chris

It's illegal.

Mother

You try telling that to the tiger.

Chris

I think it's dangerous.

Mother

Listen ... before he started fixing, he used to get through four Jehovah's witnesses a day. And he used to eat all of them, except the pamphlets.

Chris

Well he's not dim.

A very loud roar and rattling of cage.

Mother

All right!

She loads a syringe and starts to leave.

Chris

Well, I'm going to watch one of the televisions... come on Marcus.

He puts Marcus in cage and is just about to take it through to the next room.

Mother

Michael's been on the phone all day for you.

Chris

Michael?

Mother

You know, Michael...

Mother

Michael

Mother

Ellis

Mother

. He's been on the phone all day ... he came round twice.

Chris

What did he look like?

Mother

Oh, I didn't see him. The orange-rumped agouti answered the door. Only useful animal you ever bought, that.

Chris

Where is he now?

Mother

He's upstairs forging prescriptions for the sodding tiger!

Chris

No, no, where is Michael Ellis now?

Mother

Oh, I don't know... he said it wasn't important, anyway... all right, here I come.

She goes to the tiger. Chris looks confused, then shrugs and goes into the sitting room with Marcus. In the room there are about twenty old televisions on shelves. Chris selects one of the televisions, puts it on the table, switches it on and settles down to watch it with Marcus.

CAPTION

: 'UNIVERSITY OF THE AIR'

Announcer

on the TV

Announcer

Hello and welcome to the University of the Air. And first this afternoon, part seventeen in our series of lectures on animal communications. This afternoon we look at recent discoveries in the field of intraspecific signalling codes in the family formicidea.

Chris

That's a stroke of luck, Marcus...

Cut to a restaurant. A waiter (Graham) stands at one side. Our hero (Terry J) enters, the waiter approaches him and they go through an elaborate signalling or greeting ceremony, stamping and so forth. The waiter does strange series of movements.

CAPTION: 'MAY I HAVE YOUR COAT'

Hero stamps a lot and clasps the waiters bottom.

CAPTION: 'I DON'T HAVE A COAT. I AM AN ANT'

Mother

Turn that bloody thing off!

Announcer

We interrupt this programme to bring you the latest news of the extraordinary Michael Ellis saga. Apparently Michael Ellis...

Announcer

mother switches it off

Chris

Hey! I was watching that...

Mother

Bloody thing. It's upsetting the tiger.

Mother

there is a roar and a crash of breaking crockery from the kitchen

Mother

Oh Christ!

She dashes across to the door and goes into the kitchen. Chris quickly switches the TV on.

Announcer

waits for noises to stop

Announcer

... nd of the announcement. And now back to 'University of the Air', and our series for advanced medical students, 'Elements of Surgical Homeopathic Practice'. Part 68 - 'Ants'.

Chris

Ah! We're in luck again, Marcus.

A surgeon appears on television. He makes a few ant gestures.

Surgeon

Hello formicidophiles! Before the blood and guts that you're waiting to see, let's have a look at the anatomy of the little ant.

Cut to a drawing of an ant.

Ant Expert's Voice

The body of the ant is divided into three sections.

Ant Expert's Voice

arrow indicates

Ant Expert's Voice

an animated hand with a knife slices bits off the ant

Ant Expert's Voice

a hand pulls the legs off

Ant Expert's Voice

you're not so strong compared with me, four, five, six ... Ha!

Chris

I didn't know ants had

Chris

six

Chris

legs, Marcus!

Ant Expert

Well I can assure you they do, Mr Ellis.

Chris

Hey! You've got two legs missing! And that's a false feeler Marcus! Blimey!

He leaps up, switches the TV off and hurls it into the corner onto a pile of used TVs, and hurries out. The tiger is quiet now. Mother, bloody and torn, is emptying a tin of 'Kit-E-Cobra' into a box marked 'Cobra'.

Chris

I'm taking this ant back, mother - he's got two legs missing.

Mother

Hey! Mrs McWong's been on the phone! The polar bear's been in her garden again.

Chris

Well I'll get it on the way back from the store.

Mother

Well mind you do - his droppings are enormous.

Mother

Chris goes through the door, mother shouts after him

Mother

she tosses a wad out to him

Cut to the garden outside. There are TVs heaped in the garden path. Chris catches the wad of notes and leaves through the garden gate as a TV van is unloading half a dozen TVs onto a trolley, prior to wheeling them into the house.

Cut back to the store. Inside the lift. Chris stands there with his ant in his hand. There are also two ladies in Geman national costume. The lift lady, who has a wall-eye, a wooden leg, a tooth-brace, a hearing aid, a hilt-up shoe, a neck-brace, and a hook is reciting.

Lift Woman

Second floor ... stationery, leather goods, tribal head injuries, cricket bats, film stars, dolphinariums.

The lift stops with some difficulty. The German girls get out with their baggage. In gets a man in Greek national costume holding an oar.

Lift Woman

Third floor ... cosmetics, books, Irish massage, tribal head-gear, ants..

Lift Woman

Chris starts to get out

Lift Woman

complaints

Lift Woman

about ants!

Chris

Oh, where do I go to complain?

Lift Woman

Straight on, then left, then right past the thing, then, up the little stairs, then right by where it's gone all soft, then down the wobbly bit, left past the nail, past the brown stain on the wall to your right and it's the door marked exit straight ahead of you on the left.

Chris

Thank you.

Lift Woman

the doors shut but we can just hear her voice

Lift Woman

Fourth floor... kiddies' vasectomies...

The ant counter. It is obviously the same place with a roughly made sign 'Complaints'. Chris is standing there with the original Assistant, who now has a plate in his lip and an enormous false chin about eight inches long and six inches across.

Chris

I don't want you.

First Assistant

speaking with difficulty

First Assistant

Oh, something wrong with your little ant friend?

Chris

No! I'm not going to tell you.

First Assistant

Something missing in the leg department?

The Manager appears.

Manager

Can I help you, sir?

Chris looks down and sees that the Manager is half in a sack.

Chris

No! No! No! No!

Manager

Oh, it's all right, sir, it's for the sack race later on.

Chris

No, no, no, I want to speak to the General Manager, I want to complain.

Manager

Oh, well you want the Toupee Hall in that case, sir.

Chris

The what?

Manager

The Toupee Hall, Mr Ellis.

Manager

he hops off

Chris approaches a stocking counter where lady assistant is serving two heavies who are trying on nylons over their heads. Chris speaks to the assistant.

Chris

embarrassed

Chris

Excuse me - could you tell me the way to the Toupee Hall, please?

Assistant

Sorry?

Chris

The Toupee Hall.

Assistant

The what?

Assistant

Oh, the

Assistant

Toupee Hall

Assistant

loudly

Assistant

Gladys, where are toupees now?

Gladys

Toupees?

Gladys

people start to look

Assistant

This gentleman wants one.

Gladys

even louder

Gladys

A toupee?

Chris

Well, no, actually...

Gladys

I think they're in surgical appliances now.

Assistant

That's right, yes, you go left at artificial limbs and hearing aids, right at dentures and it's on your left just by glass eyes. It doesn't say toupees to avoid embarrassing people, but you can smell 'em.

People by this time have formed a ring round to see who it is.

As he moves off people peer at his head.

Woman

to friend

Woman

You can see the join.

Chris in order to avoid this embarrassment, dives into the nearest department. A sign over the door reads 'Victorian poetry reading hall'.

Cut to a poetry reading. Wordsworth, Shelley, Keats and Tennyson are present. Chris stands quietly in the comer hoping not to be noticed.

Old Lady

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, it's so nice to see such a large turnout this afternoon. And I'd like to start off by welcoming our guest speakers for this afternoon, Mr Wadsworth...

Wordsworth

Wordsworth!

Old Lady

Sorry, Wordsworth... Mr John Koots, and Percy Bysshe.

Shelley

Shelley!

Old Lady

Just a little one, medium dry,

Old Lady

a dwarf assistant pours her a sherry

Old Lady

and Alfred Lorde.

Tennyson

Tennyson.

Old Lady

Tennis ball.

Tennyson

Son, son.

Old Lady

Sorry - Alfred Lord, who is evidently Lord Tennisball's son. And to start off I'm going to ask Mr Wadsworth to recite his latest offering, a little pram entitled 'I wandered lonely as a crab' and it's all about ants.

Murmur of exalted anticipation. Wordsworth rises rather gloomily.

Wordsworth

I wandered lonely as a

Wordsworth

cloud

Wordsworth

That floats on high over vales and hills

Wordsworth

When all at once I saw a crowd

Wordsworth

A host of golden worker ants.

Ripples of applause.

Old Lady

Thank you, thank you, Mr Bradlaugh. Now, Mr Bysshe.

Shelley

Shelley.

Old Lady

Oh...

Old Lady

the dwarf refills her glass

Old Lady

... is going to read one of his latest psalms, entitled 'Ode to a crab'.

Shelley

rising: and taking his place quietly

Shelley

I met a traveller in an antique land

Shelley

Who said 'Six vast and trunkless legs of stone

Shelley

Stand in the desert

Shelley

And on the pedestal these words appear

Shelley

My name is Ozymandias, King of Ants

Shelley

oohs from his audience

Shelley

Look on my feelers, termites, and despair

Shelley

I am the biggest ant you'll ever see

Shelley

The ants of old weren't half as bold and big

Shelley

And fierce as me'.

Enormous applause.

Old Lady

Thank you Mr Amontillado. I'd like to ask one or two of you at the back not to soil the carpet, there is a restroom upstairs if you find the poems too exciting

Old Lady

she falls over

Old Lady

she falls off the podium

Keats

My heart aches and a drowsy numbness pains

Keats

My senses, as though an anteater I'd seen

Keats

panic spreads and the audience half rise

Keats

A nasty long-nosed brute

Keats

screams from the audience

Keats

With furry legs and sticky darting tongue

Keats

I seem to feel its cruel jaws

Keats

Crunch crunch there go my legs

Keats

Snap snap my thorax too

Keats

various screaming women faint

Keats

My head's in a twain, there goes my brain

Keats

Swallow, swallow, swallow, slurp

Keats

he loses control

Old Lady

Mr Keats, Mr Keats, please leave immediately.

Keats

It's true. Don't you see. It's true. It happens.

Old Lady

she bustles him out

Old Lady

Ladies and gentlemen, I do apologize for that last... well I hesitate to call it a pram ... but I had no idea ... and talking of filth... I have asked you once about the carpet ... Now, I do appreciate that last poem was very frightening... but please! Now before we move on to tea and pramwiches, I would like to ask Arthur Lord Tenniscourt to give us his latest little plum entitled 'The Charge of the Ant Brigade'.

Tennyson

Half an inch, half an inch...

Enter Queen Victoria with a fanfare, followed by Albert's coffin.

All

The Queen, the Queen.

All

they all bow and scrape

Queen Victoria

My loyal subjects, we are here today on a matter of national import. My late husband and we are increasingly disturbed by recent developments in literary style

Queen Victoria

developing a German accent

Queen Victoria

that have taken place here in Germany ... er England. There seems to be an increasing tendency for ze ent... the ent... the ant... to become the dominant ... was is der deutsches Entwicklungsbund...

Attendant

Theme.

Queen Victoria

Theme ... of modern poetry here in Germany. We are not ... amusiert?

Queen Victoria

an attendant whispers

Queen Victoria

Entertained. From now on, ants is verboten. Instead it's skylarks, daffodils, nightingales, light brigades and ... was ist das schreckliche Gepong ... es schmecke wie ein Scheisshaus... und so weiter. Well, we must away now or we shall be late for the races. God bless you alles.

Chris leaves. We cut to him outside a door with a sign saying 'Electric Kettles'.

Voice

Psst! Electric kettles over here, Sir.

A hand holding a sign saying 'Toupees' beckons him. He goes over to door and is ushered through. There are pictures of famous bald world figures with toupees on the walls.

Toupee Manager

Don't worry, sir, you're among friends now, sir.

Toupee Manager

the manager has an appalling toupee; Chris sees it and tries not to stare; the manager introduces his assistants

Toupee Manager

Bradford and Crawley come forward; each has a toupee worse than the others

Toupee Manager

These are our fitters, sir. We've had a lot of experience in this field and we do pride ourselves we offer the best and most discreet service available. I don't know whether you'll believe this sir, but one of us is actually wearing a toupee at this moment...

Chris

Well, you all are, aren't you?

They rush to a mirror.

Bradford

Have you got one?

Crawley

Yes, but I didn't know...

Toupee Manager

I didn't realize that you two... I thought it was me,

Crawley

Yes, I thought it was me.

Bradford

So did I.

Bradford

to Crawley

Bradford

That is good.

Chris

Actually, I only came in here to ask where the manager's office was.

Toupee Manager

Just a minute - someone told you we all had toupees?

Chris

No.

Crawley

Oh yeah?

Bradford

How did you know?

Chris

Well ... it's pretty obvious, isn't it?

Crawley

What do you mean obvious! His is undetectable.

Chris

Well, it's a different colour, for a start.

Bradford

Is it?

Crawley

Course it isn't!

Chris

And it doesn't fit in with the rest of his hair... it sort of sticks up in the middle.

Bradford

It's better than yours.

Crawley

Yes.

Chris

I'm not wearing one.

Chris

they all jeer

Toupee Manager

Oh, I see, you haven't got one.

Crawley

Why did you come in here then?

Chris

They told me to find the manager's office here.

They all jeer again.

Bradford

Oh no, not again.

Crawley

That's a bit lame, isn't it...

Chris

It's the truth!

All

Manager's office.

All

they laugh mockingly

Bradford

Yeah, look at it. Where did you get that, Mac Fisheries?

Toupee Manager

Dreadful, isn't it?

Crawley

Nylon?

Chris

It's not, it's real look.

Chris

he pulls it

All

Oh yeah, anyone can do that.

They all do the same. Bradford incautiously pulls his loose.

Crawley

Come on, get if off.

Chris

Get away.

Toupee Manager

Look, do you want a proper one?

Chris

No, I don't need one.

Bradford

There's no need to be ashamed.

Crawley

We've all owned up.

They all look at each other for a moment, registering 'a hard case'.

Toupee Manager

Don't you see... this is something you've got to come to terms with.

Chris

I am not wearing a toupee! They just told me to come in here to find the manager's office, to complain about my ant!

They look at each other.

Crawley

Pathetic, isn't it.

Bradford

Complain about an ant?

Toupee Manager

This is for your own good.

He grabs Chris's hair. A fight ensues in which all the assistants get their toupees dislodged. Chris is backed up against a door marked: 'Strictly no admittance'. He suddenly ducks out through this door. Cut to the other side of the door. Chris turns and double takes. It is the manager's office. There is a long line of people sitting waiting to complain. The manager looks up.

Complaints Manager

irritably

Complaints Manager

All right. Take a seat.

Chris shuts the door and takes a seat at the end of a line often people waiting to complain: the German clothes prop man; the Icelandic honey week man; a Greek with a motor tyre; a man with a lawn mower with a cat sticking out of it; a man with a bandaged nose holding a dog with a bandaged nose; a lady with a bandaged nose; a lady with a bandaged nose and a pram with a small column of smoke rising from it; a rather butch lady with her head through a tennis racket; a man with a cigar in his mouth that has obviously exploded - his face is blackened and his collar awry; a man in a terrible suit with one arm twice as long as a normal sleeve and trousers that finish at mid-thigh. A uniformed shop attendant is sitting next to a rather well dressed lady in twin set and pearls, and her equally distinguished looking husband. The attendant is occasionally touching the lady's cheek and peering into her eyes. The lady and the husband stare straight ahead. Next to them is Colonel Ewing. At the desk is the lady with the flame thrower. Part of the manager's desk and the entire corner of the office are blackened and smoking.

Lady

You see! There ought to be a safety catch on it, I mean ... ohhhh!

Lady

a spurt of flame shoots out

Lady

I mean, what if this fell into the wrong hands?

Complaints Manager

Yes, madam. I'll speak to the makers personally, all right?

Lady

Would you? It would put my mind at ease.

She leaves closing the door. We hear the flame thrower.

Lady's Voice

Sorry...

Complaints Manager

Next?

The colonel gets up. As he does so Mr Zyndenky (the husband) indicates his wife and the attendant.

Mr Zyndersky

He's still molesting her.

Complaints Manager

Yes, yes, I'll see to you in a moment, sir.

Complaints Manager

the colonel sits at the manager's desk

Colonel Ewing

I've got a complaint to make.

Complaints Manager

Do take a seat. I'm sorry it's on fire.

Colonel Ewing

Oh, not at all.

Colonel Ewing

he sits on it

Colonel Ewing

I got used to this out east.

Complaints Manager

Where were you out east?

Colonel Ewing

Oh, Norway ... Sweden ... places like that... oh I'm terribly sorry, my suit seems to keep catching fire.

Complaints Manager

Extinguisher?

Colonel Ewing

Oh no, thank you, I think we'd better let it run its course. I was just thinking... Norway is not very east, is it? I should have said when I was out north.

Colonel Ewing

he slaps at the flames

Complaints Manager

Are there many fires in Norway?

Colonel Ewing

Good Lord yes. The place is a constant blaze. Wooden buildings, d'you know. I lost my wife in Norway.

Complaints Manager

I am sorry to hear that.

Colonel Ewing

Why, did you know her?

Complaints Manager

No, I meant...

Colonel Ewing

Oh I see. No, she wasn't a favourite of mine. We were out strolling across a fiord one day when one of the local matadors came out of his tree house and flung a load of old scimitars and guillotines out that he'd got cluttering up his wine cellar and apparently rather a large proportion of them landed on my wife causing her to snuff it without much more ado.

Complaints Manager

Yes, yes - well look...

Ding-dong of store PA. An announcer speaks.

Announcer

Here is an important announcement about Michael Ellis.

Announcer

Chris looks up at loudspeaker; everyone turns towards it

Announcer

murmur of excitment

Chris

What a rotten ending.

Cut to a polite, well dressed assistant at a counter with a big sign saying 'End of Show Department' behind him.

Assistant

Well it is one of our cheapest, sir.

Chris

What else have you got?

Assistant

Well, there's the long slow pull-out, sir, you know, the camera tracks back and back and mixes...

As he speaks we pull out and mix through to the exterior of the store. Mix through to even wider zoom ending up in aerial view of London. It stops abruptly and we cut back to Chris.

Chris

No, have you got anything more exciting?

Assistant

How about a chase?

The manager and the toupee assistants suddenly, appear at a door.

Manager

There he is!

Exciting chase music. They pursue Chris out of the hall and into another part of the store. Then cut back to Chris at counter.

Chris

Oh, no, no, no.

Assistant

Walking into the sunset?

Chris

What's that one?

Dramatic sunset shot on a beach. We can just see the back of Chris and the assistant as they walk together towards the setting sun. The assistant is gesturing and describing it.

Assistant

You know ... two lone figures silhouetted against the dying rays of the setting sun. The music swells, you've got a lump in your throat and a tear in your eye...

Cut back to the store.

Chris

Oh no.

Assistant

Oh, pity, I rather like that one...

Chris

They're all a bit off the point, you see.

Assistant

Well there is one that ties up the whole Michael Ellis thing, but....

Chris

But what... ?

Assistant

Oh, no, nothing, nothing...

Chris

Look, who is this Michael Ellis?

Assistant

How about a happy ending, sir?

A girl rushes up to Chris and flings her arms around him.

Girl

Oh Chris! Thank God you're safe.

Assistant

No, you wouldn't want that, would you.

This time we see the girl has disappeared.

Chris

Why wouldn't I want that?

Assistant

What about summing up from the panel? That's cheap. You know - the big match experts.

Panel in typical football panel set. Malcolm Allison, Brian Clough, and huge still of Jimmy Hill on set behind.

Malcolm Allison

Yes. It was quite a good show. I think that the Michael Ellis character was a little overdone.

Brian Clough

Well, I don't agree with that, Malcolm, quite frankly the only bit I liked was this bit with me in it now.

Assistant

No? Slow fade?

The picture begins to fade.

Chris

Nnnn... no.

The picture comes up again.

Assistant

Well, how about a sudden ending?

Blackout.

A high street. Musical theme played on a banjo a la 'Steptoe and Son' opening. Cut to a tracking shot of two tramps walking jauntily along. They are very arch, over-the-top jolly fellows. They nod at the occasional passer-by and do mock bows to a city gent.

TITLE CAPTION: 'UP YOUR PAVEMENT'

CAPTION: 'BY THE REV. AND MRS A. G. PHIPPS'

CAPTION: 'FROM AN IDEA BY LORD CARRINGTON'

They come to a litter bin, root in it, and one of them produces a newspaper. He hands it to the other, looks in again and brings out a pork pie. He looks in again, his eyes light up, and he produces a bottle of champagne. He passes it to his mate. He looks in again and finds two highly polished glasses. Meanwhile over all this and as they set off down the road together we hear:

Voice Over

Taking life as it comes, sharing the good things and the bad things, finding laughter and fun wherever they go - it is with these two happy-go-lucky rogues that our story begins.

Voice Over

by this time the tramps have walked out of shot; cut to a shot of a sports car up on the pavement with the legs of the two tramps sticking out from underneath; the music turns more urgent and transatlantic

Voice Over

appropriate music; a James Bond character climbs out of the car and looks down at the dead tramps

Voice Over

shot of him rushing into a film premiere past photographers with flashing bulbs

Voice Over

cut to him on yacht

Voice Over

still of him with Henry Kissenger; cut to him striding down a street

Voice Over

we see him go into a doorway; cut to a low angle close up of Dr Koning donning gloves prior to the operation; the music changes to the Kildare theme

Voice Over

cut to a doorbell and pan down

Voice Over

pan down to find the doorbell and name

Voice Over

the door opens and the rear-admiral comes striding out; naval music; he walks up the road

Voice Over

cut to a still of a young inspired and devoted nurse; the music instantly changes to the heroic

Voice Over

mix to impressive college grounds

Voice Over

zoom in across lawns towards the college building

Voice Over

the camera suddenly veers off away from college and homes in on a solitary bush from which appears a seedy fellow in a terrible lightweight suit of several years ago that has got all stained and creased around the crutch

Voice Over

Len Hanky! Chiropodist, voyeur, hen-teaser. The man of whom the chairman of Fiat once said...

Cut to a high-powered Italian businessman at a desk in a very modern casa-type Italian office.

Chairman

Che cosa è lo succiacatori do polli?

SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: What is a hen-teaser?

The phone rings. He answers it dynamically and we zoom in on his tense, alert, executive face.

Voice Over

Yes! Tonight we examine the career of Gino Agnelli! The man who started from nothing to build up one of the greatest firms in Europe.

Voice Over

mix through to stock film of a big car-producing plant

Voice Over

as each of these things is mentioned we see a momentary flash of a still of each

Voice Over

at this point the freeze frame starts moving as the chaplain lifts himself out of the cockpit and jumps down beside his Spitfire

Voice Over

smiling cheerfully he crosses off another emblem of a vicar in a German helmet on the side of the plane. Beside this is written '"Here we come Kraut" Luke 17, verse 3'

Voice Over

a squadron leader, just off a mission, runs past, and dashes into a Nissen hut

CAPTION: 'SOMEWHERE IN ENGLAND, 1944'

The squadron leader enters an RAF officers' mess and takes off his helmet.

Bovril

Morning, Squadron Leader.

Squadron Leader

What-ho, Squiffy.

Bovril

How was it?

Squadron Leader

Top-hole. Bally Jerry, pranged his kite right in the how's your father. Hairy blighter, dicky-birdied, feathered back on his Sammy, took a waspy, flipped over on his Betty Harper's and caught his can in the Bertie.

Bovril

Er, I'm afraid I don't quite follow you, Squadron Leader.

Squadron Leader

It's perfectly ordinary banter, Squiffy. Bally Jerry...pranged his kite right in the how's yer father...hairy blighter, dicky-birdied, feathered back on his Sammy, took a waspy, flipped over on his Betty Harper's and caught his can in the Bertie.

Bovril

No, I'm just not understanding banter at all well today. Give us it slower.

Squadron Leader

Banter's not the

Squadron Leader

same

Squadron Leader

if you say it slower, Squiffy.

Bovril

Hold on then.

Bovril

shouts

Bovril

Wingco

Wingco

Yes!

Bovril

Bend an ear to the Squadron Leader's banter for a sec, would you?

Wingco

Can do.

Bovril

Jolly good.

Wingco

Fire away.

Squadron Leader

draws a deep breath and looks slightly uncertain, then starts even more deliberately than before

Squadron Leader

can

Squadron Leader

Bertie

Squadron Leader

...

Wingco

...No, don't understand that banter at all.

Squadron Leader

Something up with my banter, chaps?

A siren goes. The door bursts open and an out-of-breath young pilot rushes in in his flying gear.

Pilot

Bunch of monkeys on the ceiling, sir! Grab your egg and fours and let's get the bacon delivered!

General incomprehension. They look at each other.

Wingco

Do you understand that?

Squadron Leader

No, didn't get a word of it.

Wingco

Sorry old man, we don't understand your banter.

Pilot

You know...bally ten-penny ones dropping in the custard...

Pilot

searching for words

Pilot

un...Charlie Choppers chucking a handful...

Wingco

No, no...sorry.

Bovril

Say it a bit slower, old chap.

Pilot

Slower

Pilot

banter

Pilot

, sir?

Wingco

Ra-ther!

Pilot

Um...sausage squad up the blue end?

Squadron Leader

No, still don't get it.

Pilot

Um...cabbage crates coming over the briny?

Squadron Leader

No.

Others

No, no....

Stock film of a German bombing raid.

Voice Over

But by then it was too late. The first cabbage crates hit London on July the 7th. That was just the beginning.

Cut to a Whitehall war office conference room. A general is on the phone. Four other generals sit there.

General

Five shillings a dozen? That's ordinary cabbages, is it? And what about the bombs?... Good Lord, they

General

are

General

expensive.

A corporal rushes in.

Corporal

Sir!

General

Yes, what is it?

Corporal

News from the Western Front, sir.

General

Yes ... ?

Corporal

Big enemy attack at dawn, sir ...

Corporal

Well, the enemy were all wearing little silver halos, sir ... and ... they had fairy wands with big stars on the end ... and ...

General

They what ... ?

Corporal

.. and ... they had spiders in matchboxes, sir.

General

in disbelief

General

Good God! How did our chaps react?

Corporal

Well, they were jolly interested, sir. Some of them ... I think it was the 4th Armoured Brigade, sir, they ... well, they went and had a look at the spiders, sir.

General

Oh my God! All right, thank you, Shirley.

A girl emerges from under the table. She is a blonde WAAF.

General

to a sergeant

General

the sergeant opens the door, Churchill stands outside

General

the sergeant shuts the door

General

Gentlemen, it's now quite apparent that the enemy are not only fighting this war on the cheap, but they're also not taking it seriously.

Ageing General

Bastards ...

General

First they drop cabbages instead of decent bombs ...

Corporal

The crates were probably quite expensive, sir.

General

Quiet, critic! And now they're doing very silly things in one of the most vital areas of the war!

Ageing General

What are we going to do, Shirley?

General

Well, we've got to act fast before it saps morale. We're going to show these Chinese ...

Captain

Germans, sir.

General

These Germans ... we're going to show them that no British soldier will descend to their level. Anyone found trivialising this war will face the supreme penalty that military law can provide.

General

he holds a heroic pose; there is a pause during which we expect to cut; we don't; suddenly he breaks out of the pose into informality

General

That was all right, I think?

Captain

getting out drinks

Captain

Seemed to go quite well.

Cut to a courtroom in the 1940s. A courtmartial is in progress. An elderly general presides, with two others on either side of him. There is a defense counsel, a prosecutor, a clerk of court, and two men guarding the prisoner.

Presiding General

Sapper Walters, you stand before this court accused of carrying on the war by other than warlike means - to wit, that you did on April 16th, 1942, dress up as a bag of dainties, flick wet towels at the enemy during an important offensive ...

Walters

Well, sir ...

Presiding General

Shut up! Colonel Fawcett for the prosecution ...

Fawcett

Sir, we all know ...

Presiding General

Shut up!

Fawcett

I'm sorry?

Presiding General

Carry on.

Fawcett

Sir, we all know the facts of this case; that Sapper Walters, being in possession of expensive military equipment, to wit one Lee Enfield .303 rifle and 72 rounds of ammunition, valued at a hundred and forty pounds three shillings and sixpence, chose instead to use wet towels to take an enemy command post in the area of Basingstoke ...

Presiding General

Basingstoke? Basingstoke in Hampshire?

Fawcett

No, no, no, sir, no.

Presiding General

I see, carry on.

Fawcett

The result of his action was that the enemy ...

Presiding General

Basingstoke

Presiding General

where

Presiding General

?

Fawcett

Basingstoke in Westphalia, sir.

Presiding General

Oh I see. Carry on.

Fawcett

The result of Sapper Walters's action was that the enemy received wet patches upon their trousers and in some cases small red strawberry marks upon their thighs ...

Presiding General

I didn't know there

Presiding General

was

Presiding General

a Basingstoke in Westphalia.

Fawcett

slightly irritated

Fawcett

It's on the map, sir.

Presiding General

What map?

Fawcett

more irritably

Fawcett

The map of Westphalia as used by the army, sir.

Presiding General

Well, I've certainly never heard of Basingstoke in Westphalia.

Fawcett

patiently

Fawcett

It's a municipal borough sir, twenty-seven miles north-north east of Southhampton. Its chief manufactures ...

Presiding General

What ... Southhampton in Westphalia?

Fawcett

Yes sir ... bricks ... clothing. Nearby are remains of Basing House, burned down by Cromwell's cavalry in 1645 ...

Presiding General

Who compiled this map?

Fawcett

Cole Porter, sir.

Presiding General

incredulously

Presiding General

Cole Porter ... who wrote `Kiss Me Kate'?

Fawcett

No, alas not, sir ... this was Cole Porter who wrote `Anything Goes'. Sir, I shall seek to prove that the man before this court ...

Presiding General

That's the same one!

Presiding General

he sings

Presiding General

`In olden days a glimpse of stocking ...'

Fawcett

I

Fawcett

beg

Fawcett

your pardon, sir?

Presiding General

singing

Presiding General

`In olden days a glimpse of stocking, was looked on as something shocking, now heaven knows, anything goes ...'

Fawcett

No, this one's different, sir.

Presiding General

How does it go?

Fawcett

What, sir?

Presiding General

How does

Presiding General

your

Presiding General

`Anything Goes' go?

Walters

Can I go home now?

Presiding General

Shut up!

Presiding General

to Fawcett

Presiding General

Come on!

Fawcett

Sir, really, this is rather ...

Presiding General

Come on, how does your `Anything Goes' go?

Fawcett

clearing his throat and going into an extraordinary tuneless and very loud song

Fawcett

Anything goes in.

Fawcett

Anything goes out!

Fawcett

Fish, bananas, old pyjamas,

Fawcett

Mutton! Beef! and Trout!

Fawcett

Anything goes in ...

Presiding General

No, that's not it ... carry on.

Fawcett

With respect sir, I shall seek to prove that the man before you in the dock being in the possession of the following: one pair of army boots, value three pounds seven and six, one pair of serge trousers, value two pounds three and six, one pair of gaiters value sixty-eight pounds ten shillings, one ...

Presiding General

Sixty-eight pounds ten shillings for a pair of

Presiding General

gaiters

Presiding General

?

Fawcett

dismissively

Fawcett

They were special gaiters, sir.

Presiding General

Special

Presiding General

gaiters?

Fawcett

Yes, sir, they were made in France. One beret costing fourteen shillings, one pair of ...

Presiding General

What was special about them?

Fawcett

Oh ...

Fawcett

as if he can hardly be bothered to reply

Fawcett

they were made of a special fabric, sir. The buckles were made of empire silver instead of brass. The total value of the uniform was there ...

Presiding General

Why was the accused wearing special gaiters?

Fawcett

irritably

Fawcett

They were a presentation pair sir, from the regiment. The total value of the uniform ...

Presiding General

Why did they present him with a special pair of gaiters?

Fawcett

Sir, it seems to me totally irrelevant to the case whether the gaiters were presented to him or not, sir.

Presiding General

I think the court will be able to judge that for themselves. I want to know why the regiment presented the accused with a special pair of gaiters.

Fawcett

stifling his impatience

Fawcett

He ... used to do things for them. The total value ...

Presiding General

What things?

Fawcett

exasperated

Fawcett

He .. he used to oblige them, sir. The total value ...

Presiding General

Oblige

Presiding General

them?

Fawcett

Yes, sir. The total value of the uniform ...

Presiding General

How did he oblige them?

Fawcett

What sir?

Presiding General

How did he

Presiding General

oblige

Fawcett

more and more irritated

Fawcett

He ... um ... used to make them happy in little ways, sir. The total value of the uniform could therefore not have been less than ...

Presiding General

Did he touch them at all?

Fawcett

Sir! I submit that this is totally irrelevant.

Presiding General

I want to know how he made them happy.

Fawcett

losing his temper

Fawcett

He used to ram things up their ...

Presiding General

quickly

Presiding General

All right! All right! No need to spell it out! What er ... what has the accused to say?

Walters

taken off guard

Walters

What, me?

Presiding General

Yes. What have you got to say?

Walters

What can

Walters

I

Walters

say? I mean, how can I encapsulate in mere words my scorn for any military solution? The fultility of modern warfare? And the hypocrisy by which contemporary government applies one standard to violence within the community and another to violence perpetrated by one community upon another?

Defense Counsel

I'm sorry, but my client has become pretentious. I will say in his defense that he has suffered ...

Fawcett

Sir! We haven't finished the prosecution!

Presiding General

Shut up! I'm in charge of this court.

Cut to the coast of Norway. Night. Tense music. Shots of big coastal guns, cliff-top fortifications.

SUPERIMPOSED CAPTIONS: 'DRAMA!' ' ACTION!'

Build up for abut ten seconds. Cut to a cliff top looking out to sea. A grappling hook comes over and sticks in, then another, and another. Whispered voices, music, the tension rises as the rope is tightened. Then over the top comes a German, head blackened and camouflaged. Then others climb over; they are wearing haloes, pink tutus, jackboots, wands. They charge over. Stock film of guns blazing.

Opening titles

At the end of the title cut to tramps exactly as at the beginning of the show.

Then cut to two twin-set-and-pearls ladies, Mrs Elizabeth III and Mrs Mock Tudor. They are in a sitting room with vulgar furnishings. By the TV, which they are watching, stands a small Arab boy (Terry G) . He has electrodes fixed to him and wires stretching from a control box held by Mrs Elizabeth III. They are watching the tramps.

Mrs Mock Tudor

Bloody repeats!

She presses the switch. The arab boy flinches with pain and turns and switches of the TV set.

Mrs Elizabeth III

Yes, repeats or war films. It really makes you want to micturate.

Mrs Mock Tudor

People on television treat the general public like idiots.

Mrs Elizabeth III

Well we

Mrs Elizabeth III

are

Mrs Elizabeth III

idiots.

Mrs Mock Tudor

Oh no we are

Mrs Mock Tudor

not

Mrs Mock Tudor

!

Mrs Elizabeth III

Well

Mrs Elizabeth III

I

Mrs Elizabeth III

am.

Mrs Mock Tudor

How do you know you're an idiot?

Mrs Elizabeth III

Oh, I can show you!

Mrs Mock Tudor

How?

Mrs Elizabeth III

Look!

Cut to Mrs Elizabeth III coming out of the front door in a fairly well-to-do mock Tudor detached house in its own grounds. She runs headlong into a tree opposite the front door. Repeat a few times. Then she rushes into a field, digs a hole three feet deep and stands in it. Cut to her standing beside a letter box. She straps on a long false nose and pokes it through the letter box. She drinks a delicate cup of tea at a posh café and eats the whole cup. Cut to her nailing something to a lorry. The lorry starts off to reveal that she had been nailing herself to the lorry. She is dragged away. Cut to TV planners at a window, watching Mrs Elizabeth III doing silly things in a car park below them. She has a cream bun hanging from a long stick which comes out of her hat. She walks along strangely.

Chief Executive

You see the public

Chief Executive

are

Chief Executive

he has a conference tag on his lapel which reads `Chief TV Planner'; he turns from the window to a conference table, piled with drinks

Chief Executive

Yes ... you might just as well show them the last five miles of the M2 ... they'd watch it, eh?

Cut to Mrs Mock Tudor and Mrs Elizabeth III watching TV. There is a film of the motorway on it, filmed from the bank beside a bridge.

Mrs Mock Tudor

At last they done been put on something interesting.

Mrs Elizabeth III

Oh, most interesting.

Cut back to the programme planners conference.

First Planner

reading figures

First Planner

... and our figures show that the motorways are extremely popular. I mean, last time we showed a repeat of the Leicester bypass our ratings gave us 97,300,912, and ITV nought. So I do feel we ought to give B roads their own series.

Chief Executive

I'm sorry ... we just can't give you a bigger budget.

Second Planner

Budgie?

First Planner

to the second planner

First Planner

to the senior executive

First Planner

Why not?

Chief Executive

We're not the only slice of the cake, you know.

Third Planner

Wouldn't mind a slice of cake. Nice chocolate cake ... delicious ...

Second Planner

I had a budgie once you know, amusing little chap, used to stick his head in a bell ... what was his name, now ... Joey? ... Xerxes? ...

First Planner

We could repeat them ...

Third Planner

Re-heat them?

First Planner

No, repeat them ...

Third Planner

You don't re-heat cakes. Not chocolate cakes.

Chief Executive

What, repeat the cakes?

Second Planner

Mr Heath, that was the name of the budgie.

Chief Executive

looking at his watch

Chief Executive

they all scramble madly to their feet

Chief Executive

Oh no it isn't, I was looking at the little hand that goes round very fast ...

All

Damn. Blast.

They sit down again reluctantly. There is a short pause.

First Planner

I've got it. We can retitle the repeats.

Second Planner

What ... give them different names?

Chief Executive

Wouldn't that mean retitling them?

Third Planner

Brilliant!

Chief Executive

Right - all we need is new titles. And they must be damned new!

Second Planner

How about `Dad's Navy'?

Chief Executive

Mm, good, good.

First Planner

`Up Your Mother Next Door.'

Chief Executive

Even better ...

Third Planner

'Doctor At Bee'!

All

What?

There is a knock at the door.

First Planner

Someone's knocking at the door.

Chief Executive

Quite like it - bit long, though, I think.

Third Planner

Far too long.

Second Planner

`I Married Lucy.'

Chief Executive

Hasn't that been done?

Second Planner

Oh, yes, a long time ago, though, they'd never remember it.

Third Planner

`Doctor at Three'!

Chief Executive

What?

First Planner

I think someone's knocking at the door.

Chief Executive

That's even longer!

Second Planner

`I Married A Tree.'

Chief Executive

`And Mother Makes Tree.'

Third Planner

`Doctor At Cake'!

Continuous knocking on the door.

First Planner

Look! I'm not absolutely certain, but, well I do rather get the impression that there is someone actually knocking on the door at this very moment.

Chief Executive

That's ridiculous. Half the programme gone. Stop lengthening it!

Third Planner

desperate

Third Planner

`I Married A Cake'?

Second Planner

over excited

Second Planner

`I Married Three Rabbit Jelly Moulds'!

Third Planner

Prefer a cake ... specially chocky cake ...

There is by now a constant hammering.

Security Man

yells from outside door

Security Man

Open the sodding door!

Chief Executive

No, no. You can't say `sodding' on the television.

All shake their heads. The door is broken in. Enter a neo-fascist-looking security man in a wheelchair with an oriental sword through his head.

Chief Executive

You're supposed to knock!

Security Man

Sorry, sir, but there's trouble at studio five!

Second Planner

You're in security, aren't you?

Security Man

Yes, sir.

Second Planner

triumphantly

Second Planner

he smiles victoriously at others

Security Man

Sir! It's the World War series in studio five - they're not taking it seriously any more.

First Planner

You're not allowed to suggest programme titles!

Security Man

switching on a TV set

Security Man

Look!

They rush to the monitor. One of them brushes the oriental sword which is through his head.

Security Man

Ow! Mind me war wound!

All

That's it! Very good title!

On the screen we see the court martial in progress as we saw it earlier in the show, with the whole court singing.

ANIMATION:

'What a lovely day'.

Exterior, a large, tasteful, Georgian rich person's house with extensive gardens beautifully tended, croquet hoops on the lawn - all in superb taste, nothing vulgar. The sun shines tastefully. The atmosphere is calm. Birds sing. Sound of lawnmovers and cricket in the distance. Laughter from the tennis court. Sound of gardener sharpening spades in the potting shed. Out of vision, a Red Indian struggles to free himself from the rope bonds that bind him. We hear 'Where does a dream begin' being played on a cracked record.

CAPTION:

Father

I say...

Daughter

Yes, Daddy?

Father

Croquet hoops look damn pretty this afternoon.

Daughter

Frightfully damn pretty.

Mother

They're coming along awfully well this year.

Father

Yes, better than your Aunt Lavinia's croquet hoops.

Daughter

Ugh! - dreadful tin things.

Mother

I did tell her to stick to wood.

Father

Yes, you can't beat wood...Gorn!

Mother

What's gorn dear?

Father

Nothing, nothing, I just like the word, it gives me confidence. Gorn...gorn.It's got a sort of woody quality about it. Gorn. Gorn. Much better than 'newspaper' or 'litterbin'.

Daughter

Frightful words!

Mother

Perfectly dreadful!

Father

Ugh! Newspaper!...litterbin...dreadful tinny sort of words. Tin, tin, tin.

The daughter bursts into tears.

Mother

Oh, dear, don't say 'tin' to Rebecca, you know how it upsets her.

Father

to the daughter

Father

Sorry, old horse.

Mother

Sausage!

Father

Sausage...there's a good woody sort of word, 'sausage'...gorn.

Daughter

Antelope!

Father

Where? On the lawn?

Father

he picks up a rifle

Daughter

No, no, daddy...just the word.

Father

Don't want an antelope nibbling the hoops.

Daughter

No, antelope...sort of nice and woody type of thing.

Mother

Don't think so, Becky old chap.

Father

No, no 'antelope', 'antelope' - tinny sort of word.

Father

the daughter bursts into tears

Father

Oh, sorry old man.

Mother

Really, Mansfield.

Father

Well, she's got to come to terms with these things... seemly... prodding... vacuum... leap...

Daughter

miserably

Daughter

Hate 'leap'.

Mother

Perfectly dreadful.

Daughter

Sort of PVC-y sort of word, don't you know.

Mother

Lower-middle.

Father

Bound!

Mother

Now you're talking!

Father

Bound...Vole...Recidivist.

Mother

Bit tinny.

Mother

the daughter howls

Mother

the daughter runs out crying

Father

Oh dear, I suppose she'll be gorn for a few days now.

Mother

Caribou!

Father

Splendid word.

Mother

No, dear...nibbling the hoops.

Father

he fires a shot

Father

Caribou gorn.

Mother

laughs politely

Father

Intercourse.

Mother

Later, dear.

Father

No, no, the word, 'intercourse' - good and woody...Inter...course... pert...pert thighs...botty, botty botty...

Father

the mother leaves the room

Father

the mother returns and throws a bucket of water over him

Father

Oh, thank you, dear...you know, it's a funny thing, dear...all the naughty words sound woody.

Mother

Really, dear?...how about tit?

Father

Oh dear, I hadn't thought about that. Tit. Tit. Oh, that's very tinny, isn't it?

Father

the daughter returns

Father

the daughter runs out crying

Father

Oh dear...ocelot...wasp....yowling...Oh dear, I'm bored...I'd better go and have a bath, I suppose.

Mother

Oh really, must you, dear? You've had nine today.

Father

All right, I'll sack one of the servants...Simpkins!...nasty tinny sort of name. Simpkins!

Father

he exits

A pilot from the RAF banter scene enters.

Pilot

I say, mater, cabbage crates coming over the briny.

Mother

frowns and shakes her head

Mother

Sorry dear, don't understand.

Pilot

Er...cow-catchers creeping up on the conning towers...

Mother

No...sorry...old sport.

Pilot

Caribou nibbling at the croquet hoops.

Mother

Yes, Mansfield shot one in the antlers.

Pilot

Oh, jolly good show. Is 'Becca about?

Mother

No, she's gorn off.

Pilot

What a super woody sort of phrase. `Gorn orff'.

Mother

Yes, she's gorn orff because Mansfield said tin to her.

Pilot

Oh, what rotten luck ... oh well ... whole afternoon to kill ... better have a bath I suppose.

Mother

Oh, Gervaise do sing me a song ...

Pilot

Oh, OK.

Mother

Something woody.

The pilot launches into a quite enormously loud rendering of `She's going to marry Yum Yum'. The impact of this on the mother causes her to have a heart attack. She dies and the song ends.

Pilot

For ... she's going to marry Yum Yum ... oh crikey. The old song finished her orff.

Father

entering

Father

What's urp?

Pilot

I'm afraid Mrs Vermin Jones appears to have passed orn.

Father

Dead, is she?

Pilot

'Fraid so.

Father

What a blow for her.

Cut to the scene on a TV screen and pull out from the TV to Mrs Mock Tudor and Mrs Elizabeth III in their sitting room watching it.

Mrs Mock Tudor

What I want to know Mrs Elizabeth III, is why they give us crap like that, when there's bits of the Leicester by-pass what have never been shown. Biskwit?

Mrs Elizabeth III

takes biskwit from plate

Mrs Elizabeth III

Oh, thank yew ...

Mrs Mock Tudor switches her TV switch. The Arab boy winces in great pain and moves over to the set. He changes channels. Up comes a picture of the motorway again. Roller caption superimposed over the motorway. Appropriate 'Crossroads' type theme music.

Mrs Elizabeth III throws the switch and the Arab boy winces with real pain and turns the knob of the television set which changes channels. On the TV set we see the same two ladies watching their set as before with the tramps on it. They continue watching until the two ladies on the set speak.

Mrs Mock Tudor

on the TV set

Mrs Mock Tudor

Bloody repeats.

Mrs Mock Tudor

not on the TV set

As before she switches switch. The Arab boy winces in pain and changes channels.

Mrs Elizabeth III

on the TV set

Mrs Elizabeth III

Yes, repeats or war films ... makes you want to ...

She throws the switch. The Arab boy winces in pain and turns over. The White City as for show-jumping. Close up of a mounted female rider waiting to start. Voice over of Dorian Williams.

Dorian

Hello and welcome to Show-Jumping from White City ...

Mrs Mock Tudor

Oh, moto-cross!

Dorian

... and it's Anneli Drummond-Hay on Mr Softee just about to go into jump-off against the clock. The short pause is for the stewards who are repairing the Sound of Music.

Dorian

cut to shot of stewards who are organizing eight nuns, Von Trapp in Tyrolean gear, Julie Andrews, and the six Von Trapp children into a group forming a fence; cut back to Anneli

Dorian

the group start singing 'The Hills are Alive'; the bell goes for the start of the round and the lady rider sets of towards the group

Dorian

And there's the bell. She's got 1.07 seconds to beat, but she needs a clear round to win. As she comes towards the Sound of Music and ...

Cut away to the two ladies watching their TV. Shot from an angle so we can't see the screen.

Mrs Elizabeth III

Quite exciting.

Cut back to White City to see the lady rider has just cleared the obstacle. A cheer from the crowd. The music changes to 'Oklahoma'. Follow her round to see a similar group dressed as for 'Oklahoma'. Ten hayseeds and six wenches with a hay wagon. Most have primitive pitch forks and are sucking on straws.

Dorian

... beautifully taken, and now she needs to pick up speed for Oklahoma, but not too much. This is where Alan Jones knocked down poor Judd, but ... And ... she's taken it superbly!

Mrs Mock Tudor

You notice how we never actually see the horses jump.

Cheer from TV. Cut back to White City. The horse is coming away from Oklahoma. Cut to run up to Black and White Minstrels.

Mrs Mock Tudor

Wait for it ...

Cut back to White City.

Dorian

And! She's taken it ...

Dorian

cheer; we actually see the lady jumper jump over the chorus of mistrels

Dorian

She's over the Minstrels. She just flicked Leslie Crowther with her tail, but the time's good, and now she turns before coming into the final jump ... this is a tough one ... It's Ben-Hur - forty-six chariots ... 6,000 spectators ... 400 slaves, lion-handlers, the Emperor Nero and the entire Coliseum. 198 feet high. 400 years across!

The lady jumper is now coming right towards the camera. Cut back to the ladies watching.

Mrs Mock Tudor

I bet we don't see this one.

Cut back to horse actually jumping towards the camera. Cut to newsreader Peter Woods in a news studio.

Peter Woods

We interrupt show jumping to bring you a news flash. The Second World War has now entered a sentimental stage. The morning on the Ardennes Front, the Germans started spooning at dawn, but the British Fifth Army responded by gazing deep in their eyes, and the Germans are reported to have gone 'all coy'.

Music comes in underneath: 'When Does a Dream Begin'. Mix to a young airman on an airfield gazing into a WAAF's eyes. Black and white, soft focus and scratched film to look like a not very good print of a 40's film. Airman sings.

Airman

When does a dream begin?

Airman

Does it start with a goodnight kiss?

Airman

Is it conceived or simply achieved

Airman

Is it born in a moment of bliss?

Airman

Or is it begun when two hearts are one

Airman

When does a dream exist?

Airman

The vision of you appears somehow

Airman

Impossible to resist

Airman

But I'm not imagining seeing you

Airman

For who could have dreamed of this?

Airman

When reality is dismissed?

Airman

Or does it commence when we lose all pretence

Mix sound to end of signiture tune. Halfway through the song the credits roll, superimposed. They read:

Tragic music in background.

CAPTION: 'HAMLET' CAPTION: 'BY WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE' CAPTION: 'ACT ONE'

Quick cut to a close shot of a big American car skidding round a corner. Music. Montage of close ups of tires, foot on accelerator shots, etc. with a deafening sound track. The car skids to a halt at the side of the curb. Pull out to reveal it is in a smart Harley Street type location. The door opens and out gets a man in black leotard, with make-up and a small crown - Hamlet, in fact. He goes into a doorway, presses the doorbell and waits. Cut to modern psychiatrist's office. Hamlet is lying on the couch.

Hamlet

It's just that everywhere I go it's the same old thing. All anyone wants me to say is 'To be or not to be ...'

Psychiatrist

'... that is the question. Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous ...'

Hamlet

quickly

Hamlet

Yes, it's either that, or 'Oh that this too solid flesh would melt ...'

Psychiatrist

taking over

Psychiatrist

'... would melt, thaw and resolve itself into a dew. Or that the everlasting had not fixed his canon 'gainst self slaughter ...'

Hamlet

Yes. All that sort of thing. And I'm just getting really fed up.

Psychiatrist

picking up a skull

Psychiatrist

Now do the bit about 'Alas poor Yorick ...'

Hamlet

No. I'm sick of it! I want to do something else. I want to

Hamlet

make

Hamlet

something of my life.

Psychiatrist

No. I don't know that bit.

Hamlet

I want to get away from all that. Be different.

Psychiatrist

Well um ... what do you want to be?

Hamlet

A private dick!

Psychiatrist

A private dick?

Hamlet

Yes, a private dick!

Psychiatrist

Why do you want to be a private dick?

Hamlet

Ooh ... why does anyone want to be a private dick? Fame, money, glamour, excitement, sex!

Psychiatrist

Ah! It's the sex, is it?

Hamlet

Well, that's one of the things, yes.

Psychiatrist

Yes, what's the sex problem?

Hamlet

Well, there's no problem.

Psychiatrist

Now, come on, come on. You've got the girl on the bed and she's all ready for it.

Hamlet

No, no, it's nothing to do with that.

Psychiatrist

getting excited

Psychiatrist

Now come on, come on, there she is, she's all ready for it. She's a real stunner, she's got great big tits, she's really well stacked and you've got her legs up against the mantelpiece.

Dr Natal

All right, Mr Butler, I'll take over.

Dr Natal

a distinguished-looking man in a suit enters; the psychiatrist leaves

Dr Natal

Morning, Mr Hamlet. My name's Natal. Sorry to keep you waiting. Now what seems to be the problem?

Hamlet

Well, I was telling the other psychiatrist ...

Dr Natal

He's ... he's not a psychiatrist.

Hamlet

Oh. He said he was a psychiatrist.

Dr Natal

Well ... yes ... um, he's a kind of psychiatrist he's ... he's not a proper psychiatrist. He's not er ... fully qualified ... in, um, quite the sort of way we should want. Anyway the problem I believe is basically sexual is it?

The psychiatrist puts his head round door.

Psychiatrist

I asked him that!

Dr Natal

Get out!

Dr Natal

the psychiatrist goes; to Hamlet

Dr Natal

Now then, you've got the girl on the bed. You've been having a bit of a feel up during the evening. You've got your tongue down her throat. She's got both her legs up on the mantelpiece ...

Enter a distinguished-looking psychiatrist in a white coat.

Third Psychiatrist

Michael, quietly and authoritatively, indicating the door

Third Psychiatrist

Dr Natal ... out please!

Dr Natal

I'm talking to a patient! Oh ...

Dr Natal

he goes

Third Psychiatrist

Out please! I'm terribly sorry, sir. We have a lot of problems here with bogus psychiatrists. One of the risks in psychiatry I'm afraid. Unfortunately they do tend to frighten the patient and they can cause real and permanent damage to the treatment. But I assure you that I am a completely bona fide psychiatrist. Here's my diploma in psychiatry from the University of Oxford. This here shows that I'm a member of the British Psychiatric Association, a very important body indeed. Here's a letter from another psychiatrist in which he mentions that I'm a psychiatrist. This is my Psychiatric Club tie, and as you can see the cufflinks match. I've got a copy of 'Psychiatry Today' in my bag, which I think is pretty convincing. And a letter here from my mother in which she asks how the psychiatry is going, and I think you'll realize that the one person you can't fool is your mother. So if you'd like to ask me any questions about psychiatry, I bet I can answer them.

Hamlet

No, no, it's all right, really.

Third Psychiatrist

OK, you've got this girl on your bed, you've had a few drinks, you've got her stretched out and her feet on the mantelpiece ...

Third Psychiatrist

the intercom buzzes

Third Psychiatrist

yes, what is it?

Intercom Voice

There's a proper psychiatrist to see you, Dr Rufus Berg.

Third Psychiatrist

Oh, oh my God! Ok, thank you.

Third Psychiatrist

he hurriedly changes into a police constable's uniform

Third Psychiatrist

exits hurriedly

A fourth psychiatrist rushes in.

Fourth Psychiatrist

Right you've got the girl down on the bed, you've got her legs up on the mantelpiece.

Two men in white coats bundle him out. Dr Natal Enters.

Dr Natal

Well, well done, Mr Hamlet. You've done extremely well in our disorientation tests.

Hamlet

Oh? Oh!

Dr Natal

You see, I'm sorry it might have confused you a little, but we do this to try to establish a very good doctor/patient relationship, you see ... we do it to sort of, as it were, to break down the barriers. All right?

Hamlet

Yes fine.

Dr Natal

Good! Well, you've got her legs up on the mantelpiece ...

The two men come in and chase him out. Cut to a man at a consultant's desk in a smart West End surgery.

CAPTION: 'DR BRUCE GENUINE, CHAIRMAN OF THE PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION'

Dr Bruce

On behalf of the Psychiatric Association, I should like to say that we are taking firm action to clamp down on the activities of bogus psychiatrists. In fact in many areas of modern psychiatry computers are now being increasingly used for the first basic diagnosis and this has gone a long way in eliminating the danger of unqualified impostors.

Cut to Hamlet in an office. A big, impressive-looking computer beside him.

Computer

in tinny computer voice

Computer

You've had your tongue down her throat and she's got her legs on the mantelpiece.

The door opens and a nurse appears.

Nurse

Out!

The computer scuttles for the door, revealing that underneath it are six pairs of legs, in pin-striped trousers and expensive shoes. Cut to the same computer in a field. The nurse picks up a bazooka. The computer rises into the air, the nurse fires at it and it explodes.

'Nationwide' type music and credits. Michael Charlton in a studio.

Charlton

Good evening and welcome to 'Nationwide'. The programme where we do rather wet things nationally and also give you the chance to see some rather wet items in the Regions. Well, everyone is talking about the Third World War which broke out this morning. But here on 'Nationwide' we're going to get away from that a bit and look instead at the latest theory that sitting down regularly in a comfortable chair can rest your legs. It sounds very nice doesn't it, but can it be done? Is it possible or practical for many of us in our jobs and with the sort of busy lives we lead to sit down in a comfortable chair just when we want? We sent our reporter John Dull to find out.

Cut to Dull sitting in a chair on Westminster Bridge.

Reporter

Well, here I am on London's busy Westminster Bridge, seeing just how much time sitting down can take. Well, I arrived here by train at about 8:50, it's now 9:05, so I've been here approximately twelve minutes and if it's any encouragement, I must say that my legs do feel rested.

A policeman walks up to him.

Policeman

Is this your chair?

Reporter

Er ... well, no, it's a prop.

Policeman

It's been stolen!

Reporter

What?

Policeman

This belongs to a Mrs Edgeworth of Pinner - she's standing over there.

Cut to worried middle-aged lady, standing on the other side of the road, peering across. She has an identical chair in one hand.

Reporter

Ah well, it's nothing to do with me. It's just a prop which the BBC ... aaargh!

The policeman pushes the reporter off and picks up the chair.

Policeman

It's got her name on the bottom.

Policeman

he indicates: Mrs E. Edgeworth

Reporter

Well er ... perhaps you'd better give it back to her.

Policeman

You don't believe I'm a policeman, do you?

Reporter

Yes I do!

Policeman

What am I wearing on my head?

Reporter

A helmet

Policeman

correcting him

Policeman

A policeman's helmet!

Reporter

Yes.

Policeman

taking off his helmet and demonstrating

Policeman

You see that?

Policeman

That little number there?

Policeman

That is a Metropolitan Area Identification Code. No helmet is authentic without that number.

Reporter

I see.

Policeman

Kids helmets, helmets you get in toy shops, helmets you buy at Christmas. None of them is authentic ... Hang on.

Policeman

he turns and crosses the busy road

Reporter

Oh could I ...

Policeman

Hang on!

He goes across to Mrs Edgeworth, and tries to grab the other chair from her. Mrs Edgeworth resists. He clouts her and pulls the chair away. He brings it back across the road and sits down next to the reporter.

Policeman

Mind you I didn't join the police force just to wear the helmets you know. That just happens to be one of the little perks. There are plenty of jobs where I could have worn a helmet, but not such a nice helmet.

Policeman

Mrs Edgeworth is gesticulating; another policeman comes up and drags her away

Policeman

This helmet, I think, beats even some of the more elaborate helmets worn by the Tsar's private army, the so-called Axi red warriors. You know about them?

Reporter

Well, no I don't.

Policeman

Ah! Their helmets used to look like ... you got any paper?

Reporter

Well only these scripts.

The policeman gets up, looks up the street, and selects a businessman with a briefcase, who is hurrying away from him. The policeman runs up to him, grabs his arm, twists it up behind his back and wrenches the briefcase from his hand. He opens it, gets out some paper, then drops briefcase before the amazed owner, and ambles back to his chair, neatly grabbing a pen from a passer-by's inside pocket.

Policeman

I'll have that!

Man

I say!

The policeman sits down again and starts to draw, talking the while.

Policeman

Now then. Their helmet was not unlike the bobby's helmet in basic shape. It had an emblem here, and three gold - and in those days it really was gold, that's part of the reason the Tsar was so unpopular - three gold bands surmounted by a golden eagle on the apex here. Pretty nice helmet, eh?

Policeman

I think the domed helmet wins every time over the flattened job, you know, even when they're three cornered ...

Policeman

suddenly his eyes light on two office secretaries opening their packed lunch on a nearby seat

Policeman

... you want something to eat?

Reporter

sensing what's going to happen, hurriedly

Reporter

Well no, er really ...

Policeman

approaching the girls and getting out his notebook

Policeman

Hang on. You can't park here you know.

Women

bewildered

Women

We're not parked!

Policeman

No parked! What's that then?

Women

That's our lunch.

Policeman

Right. I'm taking that in for forensic examination.

Women

Why?

Policeman

Because it might have been used as a murder weapon, that's why!

Policeman

the girls look at each other; the policeman grabs their lunch

Policeman

to the reporter

Policeman

Beer?

Reporter

desperately

Reporter

No, no, please ... honestly ... please ...

The policeman walks off. There is a crash of breaking glass. An alarm bell starts to ring. The reporter winces. The policeman walks into shot again, holding two bottles of beer. He sits down, opens the beers with his teeth and hands one to reporter who is very embarrassed.

Policeman

Now, the Chaldeans, who used to inhabit the area in between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, their helmets were of the modular restrained kind of type ...

To lyrical music the camera pans across the road, and comes across a couple making love on the pavement. Pedestrians step over them.

Carol

Oh Robert, tell me I'm beautiful.

Robert

Oh you are, you are!

Carol

Oh Robert, do you mean that?

Robert

Of course I do.

Carol

You're not just saying that because I asked you?

Robert

Of course not.

Carol

Oh Robert ... Robert, are you sure it doesn't put you off?

Robert

What?

Carol

My father wanting to come and live with us.

Robert

No, of course I don't mind your father coming to live with us.

Carol

He wouldn't just be living with us.

Robert

What do you mean?

Carol

Well, he finds it very difficult to get to sleep on his own, so I said he could sleep with us.

Robert

He wants to put his bed in our room?

Carol

No, no, of course not.

Robert

Oh good ...

Carol

Our bed is plenty big enough for three ...

Carol

He'd just get into bed and go to sleep.

Robert

No. I'm not having that.

Carol

Oh Robert, I thought you loved me?

Robert

Well I do, but ...

Carol

Well, he wouldn't look.

Robert

He's bound to peek.

Carol

No, no, he wouldn't honestly.

Robert

No! No! No!!

Cut to the three of them in bed. Robert is in the middle. Father wears striped pyjamas, the others are nude. There is an uncomfortable silence.

Father

You young couple just carry on. Take no notice of me ...

Father

silence; they smile half-heartedly

Father

I don't want to feel as though I'm getting in the way.

Carol

Oh no dad, you're not.

Robert

No, no.

Father

Good.

Silence again.

Carol

Well, I think I'll get to sleep.

Father

Are you sure?

Carol

Oh yes, I'm a bit tired after the wedding.

Father

Bob, what about you?

Robert

Oh yes, all right, yes.

Father

Oh well, I seem to be O/C lights.

Carol

to Robert

Carol

Good night, darling.

Robert

Good night.

Father

Good night!

He switches the light off. It is pitch dark. There is a long pause, then a strange scraping noise like a pencil being sharpened. The scraping is followed by sawing and is eventually replaced by short sharpknocking sounds. This goes on for some time.

Carol

Father. Father, what are you doing?

Father

I'm making a boat.

Carol

What?

Father

It's the Cutty Sark. It's a model I've been making in the dark for some years now.

Carol

Well, wouldn't it be better with the light on?

Father

No, no, I'm making it in the dark, that's the point.

There is a click. The light goes on. He looks disappointed. In his hands is a completely shapeless mass of wood and nails.

Father

Oh dear, not as accurate as I thought.

Robert

It's not the Cutty Sark!

Father

Well it hasn't got its sails yet. Oh well I'll ... I'll have a look at it in the dark room in the morning. Good night.

Father

grunts from the others who are already snuggling down; lights go off; silence

Animated opening titles.

Banging on the wall from next door.

Man

Shut up! Will you shut up in there!

Cut to a middle-aged man with small moustache and neat pyjamas banging on the wall with what appears to be an Indian club.

Man

Shut up!

Man

It goes quiet next door

Man

That's better.

He walks to a side wall and hangs his club on a hook beneath big old-fashioned art-nouveau sign clearly labelled `The Burlington Wall-banger'. He goes across to bed and gets in. In the bed are a party of four Japanese businessmen in suits with lapel badges, two lady American tourists with rain hats and cameras, three other moustached English gentlemen in pyjamas, four Tour De France riders, three Swedish businessmen, and Winston Churchill. In the corner of the room are three Tour De France bicycles. All the people ae watching TV. All in the bed are slightly tear-stained and sad, and eating popcorn and crisps, utterly absorbed. On TV we hear a Hamlet sad speech.

Hamlet

I am myself indifferent honest, but then I could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me.

Cut to the TV set in the room. Close in on TV set to see Hamlet lying beside Ophelia, who is gazing at him intently. It is the same Hamlet we saw in the psychiatrist's scene. They are in one of those rather austere modern theatre sets.

Hamlet

O fair Ophelia, nymph, in thy orisons, be all my sins remembered ...

Ophelia

So anyway, you've got the girl on the bed and her legs are on the mantelpiece ...

The nurse from the psychiatrist's office enters.

Nurse

Out!

Nurse

bundles her off

ANIMATION:

Ends with a poster 'Boxing Tonite! The Killer vs. The Champ. 15 Rounds'.

Cut to a dressing room at Madison Square Gardens, table, chairs, towels, and the usual paraphernalia. Noise of a crowd outside. The door opens and in comes Mr Gabriello, and two assistants carrying a boxer on a stretcher. Smoke, action, excitement come in with them.

Mr Gabriello

That was a great fight, Champ, a great fight, you hear! Oh boy, what a fight, Champ, what a great fight! You nearly had him, Champ, you nearly had him ... where's his head?

First Assistant

I got it in here, Mr Gabriello.

He holds up a carrier bag. Gabriello goes over to it, looks inside and shouts into it.

Mr Gabriello

You were great, Champ, d'you hear, you were great!

First Assistant

looking in the bag

First Assistant

He's got a nasty cut over his eye.

Mr Gabriello

Yeah, I think it was a mistake him wearing spectacles.

Mr Gabriello

gives the bag to the assistant

Mr Gabriello

Oh well, get that sewn onto his body in time for the press pictures.

First Assistant

OK, Mr Gabriello.

Mr Gabriello

to second assistant

Mr Gabriello

Wasn't he great my boy?

Second Assistant

Eric

Second Assistant

He was great, Mr Gabriello.

Mr Gabriello

The way he kept fighting after his head came off!

Second Assistant

He was better when the head came off, Mr Gabriello. He was really dodging the guy.

Mr Gabriello

Yeah, I reckon that if he could've lasted till the end of that first minute, he would've had the Killer worried.

Second Assistant

Sure, Mr Gabriello.

Mr Gabriello

Oh he was great. Did you see his left arm?

Second Assistant

No!

Mr Gabriello

OK, we'll look around the hall after everybody's gone.

Second Assistant

Do you realize Mr Gabriello, some of those guys out there paid over $2,000 for a ringside seat.

Mr Gabriello

And where did the head land? Right at the back, that's justice...

Mr Gabriello

the door opens; a black cleaner comes in

Mr Gabriello

What d'you want?

The cleaner holds up a carrier bag.

Black Man

This your boy's head?

Mr Gabriello

No, no, we've got his head. He ain't hurt that bad.

Second Assistant

looking in the bag

Second Assistant

Hey, that's Gerry Marinello. He fought the Killer last week.

Mr Gabriello

OK, give it to me. I'm seeing his trainer tomorrow. I'll give it to him.

The cleaner is ushered out.

Second Assistant

Hey, Mr Gabriello. The press is still outside. Are you ready for them?

Mr Gabriello

How's the Champ?

First Assistant

working away with needle and thread

First Assistant

Well, the head's on OK. But there's still a left arm missing.

Mr Gabriello

OK, well keep the dressing gown kinda loose, OK.

Mr Gabriello

Gabriello goes to door and opens it

Mr Gabriello

OK boys, come on in!

The press surge in. The fighter is propped up.

First Reporter

Hey Mr Gabriello, Mr Gabriello. Did you expect your boy to last the full twenty-eight seconds?

Mr Gabriello

This boy has never let me down. He's the pluckiest goddamn fighter I've ever trained.

Second Reporter

Were you worried when his head started to come loose?

Mr Gabriello

No, no, we were expecting that. I told them to expect it to and it did. He ain't stupid.

First Reporter

Hey, can we have a word with the Champ?

Mr Gabriello

Yeah OK. But keep the questions simple.

First Reporter

Hey Champ! How're you feeling?

Mr Gabriello

angrily

Mr Gabriello

I said keep the questions simple!

Second Reporter

Mr Gabriello. People are saying that the kid ought to be buried. His head's come off in the last six fights.

Mr Gabriello

There's no question of burying the kid. He's just reaching the top.

Second Reporter

Well, shouldn't he just stay in hospital?

Mr Gabriello

No, he ain't going to no hospital. He's got the return fight next week.

Shot of the 'New York Times' headline 'Champ to be kept alive for big return'.

Cut to a hospital ward. Numerous doctors and nurses are listening to the radio.

Radio Voice

And there's Frank Sinatra leaving the ring. Behind him is George Raft, another great boxing fan, Martin Bormann, acknowledging the applause, and with him of course is Gus Himmler, who did an awful lot for the sport in his country in the early 1940s. And here comes the Champ now and he seems in good shape to meet the Killer once again. Before an audience, some of them will have paid $920,000 million for the privilege of seeing this boy get beaten up. And there's the bell.

Patient

Having a heart attack on the bed in the corner

Patient

Aaarghhh!

All

Quiet!!

Radio Voice

And a left and a right and a right jab that's taken the Champ's shoulder off. And here's the Killer again with a right and another left and a bash with a hammer and a terrific smack with a heavy thud right into the skull and there's a gaping hole right through the Champ's body now. And now the Killer's working on the cut eye with a series of beautifully placed punches and the head's coming loose.

Radio Voice

the doctors and nurses getting increasingly excited

Radio Voice

everyone cheers

Radio Voice

pandemonium breaks out in the ward - some patients cheering, doctors thumping them in disagreement

Radio Voice

general disappointment; someone changes channels

Second Radio Voice

Well here in London it's 12:30 and time for 'The Robinsons'.

Second Radio Voice

everyone perks up

Second Radio Voice

sings 'Archers' theme tune

Second Radio Voice

da di da di da di da ... and so on.

Mrs Non-Robinson

Mrs Robinson

Mrs Robinson

Morning Mrs Non-Robinson.

Mrs Non-Robinson

Been shopping?

Mrs Robinson

No, ... I've been shopping.

During this exchange there have been six cuts to close-ups of radios of different shapes and sizes.

Mrs Non-Robinson

What'd you buy?

Pull out to reveal a pepperpot. Mrs Non-Gorilla sitting beside a radio on a park bench.

Mrs Robinson

A piston engine.

Mrs Non-Robinson

What d'you buy that for?

Mrs Robinson

It was a bargain.

Mrs Non-Gorilla

Bloody rubbish.

Mrs Non-Gorilla

she turns the radio off

Quick cut to a hospital, doctor on a bed listening to a radio. It switches off.

Doctor

I wanted to listen to that!

Cut back to Mrs Non-Gorilla. Another pepperpot approaches.

Mrs Non-Gorilla

Morning Mrs Gorilla.

Mrs Gorilla

Morning Mrs Non-Gorilla.

Mrs Non-Gorilla

Have you been shopping?

Mrs Gorilla

No ... been shopping.

Mrs Non-Gorilla

Did you buy anything?

Mrs Gorilla

A piston engine!

She reveals a six-cylinder car engine on a white tray, on a trolley.

Mrs Non-Gorilla

What d'you buy that for?

Mrs Gorilla

Oooh! It was a bargain.

Start to pan away from them, their voices become fainter.

Mrs Non-Gorilla

Oooohhh!

Pan across a civic park, of which the only occupants are about ten pepperpots, dressed identically, scattered across on benches. One pepperpot is in a wheelchair. We come in to Mrs Non-Smoker, unwrapping a parcel and calling to the birds.

Mrs Non-Smoker

Come on little birdies ... come on little birdies ... tweet tweet ... come and see what mummy's got for you ...

She unwraps the parcel revealing a leg of lamb which she hurls at the gathered birds. A screech. She kills a pigeon. She reaches in a another bag and produces two tins of pineapple chunks and throws them.

Mrs Non-Smoker

Come on little birdies ... tweety tweety ... oooh look at this ... tweet tweet ... ooohhh nice one ... come on little birdies ...

She chortles with delight as she hurls a huge jar of mayonnaise which smashes messily. She then throws a large frozen turkey, a jar of onions, a bag of frozen peas, and a bottle of wine. We widen as Mrs Smoker, with an identical piston engine to the last pepperpot, comes up to Mrs Non-Smoker. Quite a large area in front of Mrs Non-Smoker is littered with packaged foods and dead birds; a bird is pecking at a tin of pate; a small pond in front of her has a swan upside down with its feet sticking in the air, a huge tin floating beside it.

Mrs Non-Smoker

Oohh hello, Mrs Smoker.

Mrs Smoker

Hello Mrs Non-Smoker.

Mrs Non-Smoker

What, you been shopping then?

Mrs Smoker

Nope ... I've been shopping!

Mrs Non-Smoker

What d'you buy?

Mrs Smoker

A piston engine!

Mrs Non-Smoker

What d'you buy that for?

Mrs Smoker

It was a bargain!

Mrs Non-Smoker

How much d'you want for it?

Mrs Smoker

Three quid!

Mrs Non-Smoker

Done.

Mrs Non-Smoker

she hands over the money

Mrs Smoker

Right. Thank you.

Mrs Non-Smoker

How d'you cook it?

Mrs Smoker

You don't cook it.

Mrs Non-Smoker

You can't eat that raw!

Mrs Smoker

Ooooh ... never thought of that. Oh, day and night, but this is wondrous strange ...

Mrs Non-Smoker

... and therefore is a stranger welcome it. There are more things in Heaven and Earth Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come, the time is out of joint. Oh cursed spite, that ever I was born to set it right. Let's go together.

They get up and go. Fade to black.

CAPTION: 'ACT TWO - A ROOM IN POLONIUS'S HOUSE'

Cut to a Frank Bough type presenter. Behind him are sports pictures.

Presenter

Hello, and welcome to 'A Room in Polonius's House'. Well tonight is European Cup night. One result is already in from Munich. The European Cup, first round, second leg, Bayern München 4397, Wrexham 1. So Wrexham going through there on aggregate. Well, now it's time for racing, so let's go straight over to Epsom and Brian McNutty.

Cut to dentist's surgery. A dentist is filling a patient. He talks to camera.

SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'LIVE FROM EPSOM'

Dentist

Well over here at Epsom, there are chances a-plenty for those who want to make a good start in...

Patient

Dentistry.

Dentist

Dentistry. It's a well-off suburb, so most people have their own teeth and surgeries are opening at a rate of four or five a week.

Cut to a housewife in a back garden standing in front of a washing line with really nasty stained washing on it: some man's trousers with very nasty stain on crotch and running down the leg, a badly torn sheet with melted chocolate bisquit stuck on it, a huge bra, with cups eighteen inches across, two pieces of streaky bacon and a fried egg pegged on the line, and more dirty washing.

CAPTION: 'LIVE FROM EPSOM'

Housewife

Well, it's only forty-four minutes from the West End on the train and it's not too built up, so you can have a nice garden. And the people of Epsom are a very nice class of person.

Cut to a property developer in a main street.

CAPTION: 'LIVE FROM EPSOM'

Property Dealer

Well here in High Street Epsom, There are ample opportunities for all kinds of redevelopment. As you can see,

Property Dealer

he indicates old houses

Property Dealer

behind me now there are a high level of low density consumer units, still not fully maximizing site value. This could be radically improved by a carefully planned programme of demolition. And of course most of the occupants ere...er...elderly folks, so they wouldn't put up much of a fight.

Cut to Epsom racecourse, and a presenter, Brian McThighbone, up against the paddock rail.

Brian

Good afternoon. Well in fact there's still a few minutes to go before the main race on the card this afternoon - the Queen Victoria Handicap. So let's have a quick word with the winner of the last race, one of the season's top jockeys - Ronnie Mau-Mau.

Brian

a jockey's cap comes into shot, which is all we ever see of him

Brian

Good afternoon, Ronnie.

First Jockey

Good afternoon, Brian.

Brian

pointing his stick-mike down

Brian

A very fine ride there, Ronnie.

First Jockey

Well, a fine horse, Brian. You know you can't go wrong.

Brian

Do you fancy your chances for the Derby?

First Jockey

vigorously nodding

First Jockey

Oh very definitely, very definitely, indeed, certainly Brian.

Brian

Well, let's just see if a colleague of yours agrees with that. Let's just have a quick word with Desmond Willet. Afternoon Des.

Another different silk hat comes into the bottom of the frame. Again all we see is the jockey's cap.

Second Jockey

Irish accent

Second Jockey

he shakes his head

Second Jockey

No chance, no chance at all.

First Jockey

nodding vigorously

First Jockey

No, no I think you're wrong there, Des, with the right kind of going, he's going to be in there at the finish, Des.

Second Jockey

shaking vigorously

Second Jockey

No chance, there's no chance.

Brian

Well in fact I can see last season's top jockey, Johnny Knowles.

Brian

two caps move over

Brian

Good afternoon, Johnny.

Pause. Not even a cap is seen.

Third Jockey

faintly

Third Jockey

Hello Brian.

Brian

Er, could we have a box for Johnny please.

Brian

a cap comes into sight

Brian

Thank you.

Third Jockey

Hello Brian.

Brian

Thats better. Well there you are. Three well-known faces from the racing world. Thanks very much for coming along this afternoon, lads.

All

Not at all.

All

vigorous nodding of caps

Brian

And the best wishes for the Derby.

All

Ah, thank you, Brian, Thanks very much.

All

they leave nodding

Brian

Well in fact I hear they're ready for us now at the start of the main race this afternoon. So let's go right away and join Peter at the start.

A view of the starting stalls, shot so we cannot see inside.

CAPTION: '3.15 QUEEN VICTORIA HANDICAP'

Voice Over

Well they're under starter's orders for this very valuable Queen Victoria Handicap. And they're off,

Voice Over

the starting stall doors fly open; out come eight identically dressed Queen Victorias who go bustling off up the field

Voice Over

a low angle shot as the Queen Victorias appear over the fence and thunder towards the camera

Voice Over

And at the first fence it's Queen Victoria just ahead of Queen Victoria and Queen Victoria falling away in third place. And Queen Victoria in the lead as they ...

Cut back to the presenter in the studio; he is completely dressed as Queen Victoria, apart from his face.

Presenter

Well a very exciting race there at Epsom. And now over to the European Cup at Barcelona where the latest news is that Miguel Otana, the burly Real Madrid striker, was sent off for breaking wind in the forty-third minute. He'd already been cautioned for pursing his lips earlier on in the game and now he's off! So let's see a playback of that ... Brian.

Cut to Brian, dressed the same way.

Brian

Yes ... er ... well as you can see ... there's Otana now

Brian

brief stock shot of football match

Brian

cut back to Brian

Brian

and er ... he makes no attempt to play the ball. He quite deliberately lets off! And to my mind he was within the box and the referee had no option whatsoever but to send him off.

Cut to the presenter.

Presenter

Jimmy?

We cut to the real Jimmy Hill dressed as Queen Victoria, veil, crown and all.

Jimmy Hill

Good evening.

Presenter

What do you make of that?

Jimmy Hill

Well the referees really are clamping down these days. Only last week the Belgian captain was sent off for having a Sony radio cassette player. And Gonerelli, the huge Italian defender, was sent off in Turin for having his sitting and dining room knocked through to form an open living area.

Presenter

Hamlet?

Cut to Hamlet.

Hamlet

Good evening.

Cut quickly back to the presenter.

Presenter

Well you've got the girl on the bed and her legs up on the mantelpiece ...

The nurse enters.

Nurse

Out, out, come on, come on, out ...

Nurse

she hustles the presenter out of studio

Animated sketch.

CAPTION: 'ACT FIVE - A HAM IN THE CASTLE'

Mix to the theatre set we saw before. All the cast are dressed as Queen Victorias, except for Hamlet and Ophelia.

Fade out. Fade up on a moor. An explosion has just take place. Out of the smoke a ragged man walks towards the camera.

Man

And then...

Animated titles.

A street in Ruislip, morning. A scrap cart is going down the street.

Scrap Man

Let's bring 'em out! Any old iron! Any old iron!

A door opens and a homewife brings out a rather sophisticated-looking ground-to-air missile system, and dumps it on the cart.

Scrap Man

Thank you.

Another door opens and a couple of rather respectable-looking old ladies bring out two bazookas and assorted shells and put them by the gate. There are further contributions of arms from householders. A GPO van comes up the street, passes the scrap cart and comes to rest up by the camera. There is a pillar box with a cover on it on the pavement, plus a rostrum with PA and bunting. A lord mayor is ushered out of the van by a post office official. The mayor and several ladies sit on the rostrum. Clearing his throat, the GPO official gets up, tests the microphone and starts to speak in a slightly strange voice.

GPO Official

We are here today to witness the opening of a new

The first two sentences of the next voice over are laid over the end of the French speech.

Voice Over

A perfectly ordinary morning in a perfectly ordinary English suburb. Life goes on as it has done for years.

Cut to a suburban railway station.

Voice Over

But soon this quiet pattern of life was to change irrevocably. The commonplace routine of a typical Monday morning would never be the same again, for into this quiet little community came ... Mr Neutron!

A train stops at the station. The train doors open and out steps Mr Neutron. He looks like an American footballer, with enormous shoulders, tapering to a thin waist. He has very regular features and piercing eyes and is most impressive. He stands at the door of the train for a moment. The words 'Mr Neutron' are written in bold diagonally across his chest. He carries a Sainsbury's shopping bag.

Voice Over

Mr Neutron! The most dangerous and terrifying man in the world! The man with the strength of an army! The wisdom of all the scholars in history! The man who had the power to destroy the world.

Voice Over

animation of planets in space

Voice Over

Mr Neutron. No one knows what strange and distant planet he came from, or where he was going to!... Wherever he went, terror and destruction were sure to follow.

Cut to Neutron's garden. He has three little picnic chairs out and is having tea with Mr and Mrs Entrail, a middle-aged couple. The lady, a little overdressed dominates. Mr Entrail sits there rather sourly.

Voice Over

Mr Neutron! The man whose incredible power has made him the most feared man of all time... waits for his moment to destroy this little world utterly!

Mrs Entrail

Then there's Stanley ... he's our eldest ... he's a biochemist in Sutton. He's married to Shirley...

Mr Neutron

in a strange disembodied voice, grammatically correct but poor in intonation

Mr Neutron

Shirley who used to be the hairdresser?

Mrs Entrail

Yes, that's right, I think she's a lovely person.

Mrs Entrail

indicates her husband

Mrs Entrail

My husband doesn't ... he thinks she's a bit flash.

Mr Entrail

I hate 'er! I hate 'er guts.

Mrs Entrail

And they, of course, they come down most weekends, so you'll be able to meet them then.

Mr Neutron

l'd ... love ... to. Hairdressing is very interesting.

Mrs Entrail

And very important, too. If you don't care for your scalp, you get rabies. Then there's Kenneth, he's our youngest. Mind you, he's a bit of a problem... at least my husband thinks he is, anyway.

Mr Entrail

Nasty little piece of work, he is, I hate him!

Mrs Entrail

Mind you, the one we hear so much about nowadays is Karen. She married a Canadian - he's a dentist - they live in Alberta - two lovely children, Gary who's three, Leslie who's six. They look like the spitting image of Karen. D'you want to see a photo ... ?

Mr Neutron

Oh, yes please.

Mrs Entrail

All right.

She goes to get a photograph.

Mr Entrail

They're a couple of little bastards. I hate 'em. They've got eyes like little pigs, just like their mother. She's a disaster ... a really horrible-looking person, she is. I thought that one would stay on the shelf, but along comes this stupid dentist git. He's a real creepy little bastard, he is. I hate 'im.

Mr Neutron

This is a nice area.

Mr Entrail

It's like a bloody graveyard. I hate it.

Mr Neutron

It's handy for the shops and convenient for the West End.

Mr Entrail

If you like going to the West End. I think it's a stinking dump.

Cut to a well-guarded American government building, with the letters 'FEAR' on a board outside.

Voice Over

Meanwhile in Washington, at the headquarters of 'FEAR' - the Federal Egg Answering Room - in reality a front name for 'FEEBLE' - the Free World Extra-Earthly Bodies Location and Extermination Centre... all was not well.

A high-security operations room - maps, charts. monitor screens. A message comes chattering over the teleprinter. A teleprinter operator rips it out and takes it over to Captain Carpenter who sits at a control desk.

Captain Carpenter

Good God!

Captain Carpenter

he grabs a red flashing phone

Captain Carpenter

Get me the Supreme Commander Land, Sea and Air Forces, immediately!

Cut to a large room, empty apart from a very large desk with a large American eagle emblem above it. We hear American military music. There is nothing on the desk, except for a very futuristic, dynamic-looking intercom. Behind the desk the supreme commander sits. After a moment, slowly and rather surreptitiously, he sniffs his left armpit inside his jacket. Then, with a quick look around to see that no one is watching, he smells the other armpit. He sits up again, then cups his hand in front of his face to smell his breath. He looks worried still. He reaches down slowly and takes his shoe off. He has just brought it up to his nose when the intercorn buzzes loudly and a light flashes. The music stops. He jumps, and quickly takes his shoe off the desk. He presses a switch on the intercom.

Commander

Hello?

Carpenter

This is Captain Carpenter sir, from FEAR.

Commander

You mean FEEBLE?

Carpenter

Yes, sir ...

Commander

What is it?

Carpenter

Mr Neutron is missing, sir!

Commander

Mr Neutron! Oh my God! OK - Surround the entire city! Send in four waves of armed paratroopers with full ground-to-air missile support! Alert all air bases! Destroy all roads! We'll bomb the town flat if we have to!

Carpenter

Sir! Sir! He's not in Washington, sir.

Commander

OK! Hold everything! Hold everything! Hold it! Lay off! Lay off... Where is he?

Carpenter

We don't know, sir ... all we know is he checked out of his hotel and took a bus to the airport.

Commander

All right! I want a full-scale Red Alert throughout the world! Surround everyone with everything we've got! Mobilize every fighting unit and every weapon we can lay our hands on! I want... I want three full-scale global nuclear alerts with every army, navy and air force unit on eternal standby!

Carpenter

Right, sir!

Commander

And introduce conscription!

Carpenter

Yes, sir!

Commander

Right!

He slams the intercom button down and sits there. Silence again. His eyes look from side to side then slowly he goes back to smelling himself.

Voice Over

So the world was in the grip of FEAR! A huge and terrifying crisis generated by one man!

Voice Over

zoom into Neutron in his front garden, weeding; behind him the group of GPO people are sitting opening another box fifty yards further down from the first one; a line of six recently opened boxes stretches up the road

Voice Over

... easily the most dangerous man the world has ever seen, honestly. Though still biding his time, he could strike at any moment. Could he be stopped in time?

A lady stops and chats to him.

Mrs Smailes

You've got a bit of work to do there, then.

Mr Neutron

Yes, it is a problem.

Mrs Smailes

Mrs Ottershaw never used to bother ... then of course she was very old... she was 206! Well, must be going... if you need any help I'll send Frank round. He could do with a bit of'exercise, ha! ha! ha! ha! ... Fat old bastard...

She walks off. Neutron goes back to his weeding. Cut back to the supreme commander's office. He is sniffing himself again, only this time he has his whole shirt front pulled up and he is trying to smell under his shirt. The intercom goes. He quickly tucks his shirt in and depresses the switch.

Commander

Yes?

Carpenter

Captain Carpenter here, sir. We've been on red alert now for three days, sir, and still no sign of Mr Neutron.

Commander

Have we bombed anywhere? Have we shown 'em we got

Commander

teeth

Commander

?

Carpenter

Oh yes, sir. We've bombed a lot of places flat, sir.

Commander

Good. Good. We don't want anyone to think we're chicken.

Carpenter

Oh no! They don't think that, sir. Everyone's really scared of us, sir.

Commander

Of us?

Carpenter

Yes, sir.

Commander

pleased

Commander

Of our power?

Carpenter

Oh yes, sir! They're really scared when they see those big planes come over.

Commander

Wow! I bet they are. I bet they are. I bet they're really scared.

Carpenter

Oh they are, sir.

Commander

Do we have any figures on how scared they are?

Carpenter

No ... no figures, sir. But they sure were scared.

Commander

Ah! But it's not working?

Carpenter

No, sir.

Commander

OK. We'll try another tactic. We'll try and out-smart this Neutron guy. Yes, there's one man who could nail him.

Carpenter

One guy? That won't frighten anyone, sir.

Commander

He's the most brilliant man I ever met. We were in the CIA together. He's retired now. He breeds rabbits up in the Yukon... '

Carpenter

What's his name, sir?

Commander

His name is Teddy Salad.

Carpenter

Salad as in... ?

Commander

Lettuces, cucumber, radishes. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Carpenter

Where do I find him, sir?

Commander

The Yukon. Oh, and Carpenter ...

Carpenter

Yes, sir?

Commander

Make sure you get a decent disguise.

Cut to the Yukon. Carpenter is trekking along. He is in ballet tights and heavy make-up with a big knapsack with 'Nothing to do with FEEBLE' on the back. He comes across a log cabin in the middle of nowhere. He presses the doorbell. A rather twee little chime. The door is opened by a huge lumberjack.

Carpenter

Oh, hello. My name's Carpenter. I'm from the US Government.

Lumberjack

Are you from the army?

Carpenter

Er... no... I'm... er... I'm... I'm from the ballet. The US Government Ballet.

The lumberjack's eyes light up.

Lumberjack

The ballet! The ballet's coming here?

Carpenter

Well maybe...

Lumberjack

Oh, that's great! We love the ballet. Last year some of us from Yellow River got a party to go see the ballet in Montreal.

Dimly we can see behind the lumberjack a bevy of beautiful boys of all nations.

Carpenter

Look, I was wondering...

Lumberjack

Oh, we had a

Lumberjack

marvellous

Lumberjack

time. It was Margot Fonteyn dancing 'Les Sylphides'... oh, it was so beautiful...

Carpenter

Do you know...

Lumberjack

Do you know how old she is?

Carpenter

Who?

Lumberjack

Margot Fonteyn.

Carpenter

No.

Lumberjack

She's 206!

Carpenter

Look, I hear there's a US

Carpenter

ballet

Carpenter

organizer round these parts by the name of Teddy Salad.

Lumberjack

You mean the special agent?

Carpenter

Well...

Lumberjack

He's an ex-CIA man. He's not a ballet dancer.

Laughter from the boys in the hut.

Carpenter

Well, I just want to see him on some ballet business...

Lumberjack

Well, you could try the store...

Carpenter

Oh, thank you.

Carpenter

he turns to go

Lumberjack

Hey! Can you get us Lionel Blair's autograph?

Carpenter walks away.

Voice Over

While precious time was being lost in Canada, the seconds were ticking away for the free world...

Jarring chord. Cut to Neutron's house. He is hanging flowery print wallpaper in his sitting room. Helping him is the quite enormously vast Frank Smailes who stands rather helplessly looking up at Neutron who is on a plank between two ladders.

Voice Over

Already Neutron - who, you will remember, is infinitely the most dangerous man in the world, he

Voice Over

really

Voice Over

is - was gathering allies together.

Mr Neutron

Try having an omelette for your evening meal... perhaps with yogurt and grapefruit.

Mr Smailes

Oh, I've tried that ... I once got down to fifty-six stone. But I couldn't stay like that. I used to take potatoes wherever I went. I used to go to the cinema with three hundredweight of King Edwards, I'd eat 'em all before I got out of the toilet. I had to go on to bread.

Mr Neutron

What about salad?

Mr Smailes

Teddy Salad?

Mr Neutron

No, no, no - salad - as in lettuces, radishes, cucumber...

Cut to Carpenter in a log cabin trading post with trestle tables. Six Eskimos are sitting in a group at one end of the other tables. An Italian chef in a long white apron and greasy shirt, is standing over Carpenter. Carpenter sits at one table with a huge fresh salad in front of him.

Italian

You don't like it?

Carpenter

No, I didn't want to

Carpenter

eat

Carpenter

a salad. I wanted to find out about a man called Salad.

Italian

You're the first person to order a salad for two years. All the Eskimos eat here is fish, fish ...

First Eskimo

very British accent

First Eskimo

not

First Eskimo

Eskimos.

Second Eskimo

Where's our fish. We've finished our fish.

Italian

What fish you want today, uh?

First Eskimo

Bream please.

Italian

Bream! Where do I get a bream this time of year? You bloody choosy Eskimo pests.

First Eskimo

We are

First Eskimo

not

First Eskimo

Eskimos!

Italian

Why don't you like a nice plate of canelloni?

Eskimos

Eurrrrghhh!

First Eskimo

That's not fish.

Italian

as he turns to go in kitchen

Italian

I've had my lot of the Arctic Circle. I wish I was back in Oldham ...

Carpenter crosses to the Eskimos.

Carpenter

speaking slowly, and clearly as for foreigners

Carpenter

Do any of you Eskimos ... speak ... English?

First Eskimo

We're not Eskimos!

Third Eskimo

I am.

Others

Sh!

Italian

off

Italian

Haddock!

Eskimos

Where?

Carpenter

still speaking as if to foreigners

Carpenter

Do any of... you ... know... a man ... called ... Salad?

First Eskimo

What, Salad as in...

Carpenter

Lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes ... yes.

First Eskimo

Like you have on your plate?

Carpenter

Yes. That's right.

First Eskimo

No, I'm afraid not.

Second Eskimo

Where's our fish?

First Eskimo

What does this Teddy Salad do?

Carpenter

He's a... er... hen-teaser.

Quick cut to the chairman of Fiat in his office.

Chairman

Che cosa è la stucciacatori di polli?

SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'WHAT IS A HEN-TEASER?'

Cut back to the cabin.

First Eskimo

No, the only Teddy Salad we know is a CIA man.

Carpenter

Oh, he might know.

Eskimos

chanting

Eskimos

Gunga gunga, where's our fish?

Carpenter

Where will I find him?

Second Eskimo

Oh, he lives up at Kipper Sound.

Carpenter

Thanks a lot.

Eskimos

Fishy fishy iyoooiyooo.

First Eskimo

Are you in international spying, too?

Carpenter

No... no... I'm with the... US Ballet... force... who are you with?

First Eskimo

leans forward confidentialy

First Eskimo

MI6. But not a word to the Eskimos.

Eskimos

Fishy fishy igooo.

The Italian chef appears.

Italian

Here's your bloody fish.

First Eskimo

Thank you, Anouk.

Italian

I'm not an Eskimo!

Cut to Arctic wastes - ice and snow and bitter blasting winds. Carpenter - his little tadger tiny as a tapir's tits - struggles on. He stops and peers ahead He sees a trapper figure with a sled pulled by four huskies. Carpenter hurries on and catches him up.

Carpenter

Hey! Hey!

The man stops. On his sled are supplies including two ladies in bikinis, deep-frozen and wrapped in cellophane bags.

Carpenter

Hi! I'm Carpenter of the US Ballet.

Trapper

Hey, great to have you around. The last decent ballet we got around here was Ballet Ramben..On Thursday they did 'Petrouchka', then on Saturday they did 'Fille Mal Gardée'. I thought it was a bit slow...

Carpenter

stopping him short

Carpenter

It sure is nice to see you, Mr Salad.

Trapper

I ain't Salad.

Carpenter

What?

Trapper

You want Teddy Salad?

Carpenter

Yeah ...

Carpenter

the man looks around rather furtively, to see if anyone is watching, then takes Carpenter's arm and indicates the dog team

Carpenter

I don't see anyone.

Trapper

The one on the end, on the right. That's Salad.

Carpenter

That's a dog!

Trapper

confidentially

Trapper

bits

Trapper

of it.

Carpenter

What do you mean?

Trapper

Listen, Teddy Salad is the most brilliant agent the CIA ever had, right?

Carpenter

Right.

Trapper

That's how he made his name

Trapper

indicates the dog

Trapper

- disguise!

They look at the dog in silence for a moment.

Carpenter

That's incredible!

Trapper

He had to slim down to one and a half pounds to get into that costume. He cut eighteen inches off each arm and over three feet off each leg. The most brilliant surgeon in Europe stuck that tail on.

Carpenter

What about the head?

Trapper

All of the head was removed apart from the eyes and the brain in order to fit into the costume.

Trapper

D'you want to talk to him?

Carpenter

Yeah, sure.

Trapper

looking around him again

Trapper

OK, let's move over to those trees over there... anyone might be watching.

They pull over to a lone deciduous tree in the middle of the empty tundra wastes. They pull in. The man goes round to the dog and kneels down beside it.

Trapper

softly

Trapper

Mr Salad? ... There's Mr Carpenter to see you.

Carpenter

What does he say?

Trapper

to Carpenter

Trapper

Carpenter feels rather helplessly in his pockets

Trapper

he produces a bone, which he gives to the dog

Trapper

the dog tucks into the bone

Trapper

All right, you've got his trust, now, you can talk to him.

Carpenter

kneeling rather awkwardly down beside the dog, and speaking confidentially

Carpenter

he looks significantly at the dog, but the dog doesn't react

Carpenter

The General says you're the only one who'll know where to find him ... What's he say?

Trapper

He wants to go walkies.

Carpenter

Walkies?

Trapper

Yeah, he's right into it today - d'you mind taking him for walkies?

He gives the dog to Carpenter on a lead. Carpenter hesitates and then walks off with the dog, bending down occasionally and explaining the situation.

Voice Over

While Carpenter took the most brilliant agent the CIA ever had for walkies, events in the world's capitals were moving fast!

Cut to a picture of the outside of l0 Downing Street. Zoom in on the door. Music: 'Rule Britannia' type theme. Cut to interior - a few circular tables, dim lighting. The decor of a rather exclusive restaurant. Subdued murmur of upper-class people stuffing their faces. A gypsy violinist is going from table to table playing and singing. In the middle of all this there is the prime minister at a big leather-topped desk, covered with official papers, three telephones, an intercom, tape recorder, a photo of Eisenhower with a very small bunch of flowers in front of it in a sort of self-contained shrine, an in/out tray, blotter, etc. The intercom buzzes.

Voice

The Secretary of State to see you, Prime Minister.

Prime Minister

Very well, show him in.

The prime minister switches off. The secretary of state enters, wending his way through the tables. He sits at the desk. He is in a rather agitated condition.

Secretary of State

Prime Minister.

Prime Minister

Do take a seat.

He takes a seat from the next table; the lady sitting on it falls to the floor.

Secretary of State

Prime Minister, we've just had the Supreme Commander US Forces on the phone. Apparently they want a full-scale Red Alert!

Prime Minister

They what?

The gypsy violinist has come round to the desk. He is playing a sad, slow melody and smiling encouragingly at them. They glance at him. He flashes a white smile. The secretary of state drops his voice and huddles closer to the prime minister.

Secretary of State

They want a full-scale Red Alert - every troop movement...

As the secretary leans forward so does the gypsy, musing the secretary to break off in mid-sentence.

Prime Minister

It's all right - don't worry about Giuseppe...

Prime Minister

the secretary looks at the gypsy who smiles again toothily

Prime Minister

He's English really.

Secretary of State

Well apparently the whole structure of world peace may be threatened unless we immediately...

Giuseppe

heavy accent, leaning forwards

Giuseppe

Your anniversary, signore?

Prime Minister

No, no, Giuseppe - not now.

Giuseppe

indicating the secretary of state

Giuseppe

You mean zis isn't ze lady?

Prime Minister

No.

Giuseppe

Oh, signora ... my mistake! I play for you 'My Mistake'.

Giuseppe

before the prime minister can stop him he goes into a strident Italian song

Giuseppe

strums violently and starts on the second verse

Giuseppe

'Oh my mistake...'

Prime Minister

Giuseppe, do you mind playing over there.

Giuseppe

flashing a winning smile

Giuseppe

Very well, signor. But I play only for you... and your beautiful companion.

He moves off mysteriously, singing the mistake song.

Secretary of State

Well anyway, this Mr Neutron, is located somewhere in the London area. We must find and exterminate him. The Americans say if we don't, they will.

Prime Minister

straining to hear over noise of singing

Prime Minister

What?

Secretary of State

The Americans say if we won't

Secretary of State

they

Secretary of State

will!

Prime Minister

That he doesn't know

Prime Minister

what

Prime Minister

?

Secretary of State

They'll bomb the entire London area.

Prime Minister

getting up

Prime Minister

he grabs the photo of Eisenhower

Secretary of State

They won't bomb

Secretary of State

here

Secretary of State

.

Prime Minister

Are you sure?

Secretary of State

Sure.

Prime Minister

sitting down with great relief

Prime Minister

Right. When are they going to start?

Secretary of State

Well apparently they haven't got Neutron yet... but when they do...

The diners have by this time joined a conga led by the gypsy violinist playing 'My Mistake'. Awfully heartily they dance past the prime minister's desk. Cut to Artic wastes. The wind howls. The trapper is sitting beside a fire, picking his nose thoughtfully and tending a stewpan. The dog bounds back, Carpenter on the end of his lead, breathless from trying to keep up.

Trapper

Well. Did he tell you anything?

Carpenter

worn out by the walk

Carpenter

No ... we chased sticks ... we chased a few reindeer...

Trapper

patting the dog

Trapper

You been chasing reindeer, have you? You're a naughty boy... yes... ain't you a naughty boy...

Carpenter

Look, we haven't got much time ... He hasn't given me any information yet...

Trapper

OK. Tell you what, let's eat. You give him one of your meatballs, he'll tell you anything... OK?

Carpenter

OK.

Suddenly the dog woofs, gets up on back legs and starts pawing the trapper.

Trapper

Wait a minute - he's trying to tell us something.

A strangled, strained American voice comes from within the dog. Slightly muffled perhaps.

Dog

Carpenter ... er ... ugh ... ah...Carpenter...

Carpenter

kneeling down and peering into the dog's face

Carpenter

Yes, Mr Salad? Can you hear me?

Dog

Yes... yes... it's just it's so goddam painful in here... what's the problem?

Carpenter

It's Mr Neutron, sir ... he's gone missing. The Supreme Commander wants you to take charge.

Dog

I ... oh God ... I ... I ... I...

Carpenter

Yes, Mr Salad?

Dog

I gotta go walkies again.

Cut to the office of the supreme commander. He is now nude behind his desk. A kidney bowl full of water is on desk; he is dabbing at himself with a sponge. The intercom buzzes. He switches it on.

Voice

Still no sign of Captain Carpenter, sir... or Mr Neutron.

Commander

OK. We'll bomb Neutron out. Get me Moscow! Peking! and Shanklin, Isle of Wight!

Cut to stock film of B52s on a bombing raid.

Voice Over

And so the Great Powers and the people of Shanklin, Isle of Wight, drew their net in ever-tightening circles around the most dangerous threat to peace the world has ever faced. They bombed Cairo, Bangkok, Cape Town, Buenos Aires, Harrow, Hammersmith, Stepney, Wandsworth and Enfield... But always it was the wrong place.

Cut to an area of smoking rubble. A van with the words 'US Air Force' on the side trundles through the rubble. It has a loudspeaker on the top of it.

Loudspeaker

Sorry Enfield!... We apologize for any inconvenience caused by our bombing... sorry...

Voice Over

But what of Mr Neutron, the most fearfully dangerous man in the world! The man who could destroy entire galaxies with his wrist, the man who could tear fruit machines apart with his eyeballs... He had not been idle!

Meantime we have mixed through to Neutron's suburban sitting room. He is standing in the doorway gazing at something off camera. He holds an envelope which he has just opened and a letter.

Voice Over

In fact he had fallen in love... with the lady who 'does' for Mrs Entrail...

The camera pans across to a slovenly char in paisley apron, furry slippers and head scarf. Throughout this scene we hear the sound of bombers and the distant muffled sound of explosions.

Mrs Scum

Oh 'ello Mr N, terrible about Enfield, innit? It's all gone. So's Staines ... lovely shops they used to have in Staines... and Stunmore, where the AA offices used to be. I don't know where we'll pay our AA subscriptions to now. Do you know where we'll have to pay our AA. subscriptions to now, Mr N?

Mr Neutron

I didn't know you were a member of the AA Mrs S.C.U.M.

Mrs Scum

Oh yes. Ever since the Corsair broke down in Leyonstone ... they towed it all the way to Deauville FOC.

Mrs Scum

Mr Neutron looks blank

Mrs Scum

Free of Charge. Well my husband Ken, K.E.N., he said...

Mr Neutron

Oh, forget about your husband, Mrs S.C.U.M. - or may I call you Mrs S?

Mrs Scum

You can call me Linda, if you like.

Mr Neutron

No, I'd rather call you Mrs S.

Mrs Scum

Oh...

Mr Neutron

as if trying to soften the blow

Mr Neutron

And you can call me Mr N.

Mrs Scum

Well... that's what I was calling you.

Mr Neutron

Mrs S, there is something I have to tell you...

Mrs Scum

Yes, Mr N?

Mr Neutron

I have just won a Kellogg's Corn Flake Competition.

Mrs Scum

Oh Mr N! That's wonderful!

Mr Neutron

I got the ball in exactly the right place. The prize is £5,000 in cash, or as much ice cream as you can eat.

Her eyes go round as saucers and all thoughts of returning to her marital bed vanish under the impact of such imminent wealth.

Mrs Scum

£5,000!

Mr Neutron

I was thinking of taking the ice cream.

Mrs Scum

alarmed

Mrs Scum

Oh no!

Mr Neutron

It's been so hot recently.

Mrs Scum

You couldn't eat that much ice cream Mr N.

Mr Neutron

Mrs S, I can eat enormous quantifies of ice cream without being sick.

Mrs Scum

Oh no! Take the £5,000! Please take the £5,000.

Mr Neutron

I was thinking. If we got married...

Mrs Scum

Oh yes!

Mrs Scum

she sits very close to him

Mr Neutron

We could use the £5,000 to buy a spoon...

Mrs Scum

Oh! We could buy a lot more than that!

Mr Neutron

And then fill up with ice cream.

Mrs Scum

No! Forget about the ice cream. We need the money.

Mr Neutron

We need nothing. For there is something I have not told you Mrs S.C.U.M.

Mrs Scum

Oh please call me Mrs S.

Mr Neutron

No I would rather go back to calling you Mrs S.C.U.M., Mrs S.C.U.M. I am the most powerful man in the universe. There is nothing I cannot do.

Mrs Scum

Oh Mr N.

Mr Neutron

I want you to be my helpmate. As Tarzan had his Jane, as Napoleon had his Josephine, as Frankie Laine had whoever he had, I want you to help me in my plan to dominate the world!

Mrs Scum

Oh Mr N. That I should be so lucky!

Mr Neutron

You're not Jewish are you?

Cut back to the Yukon. The trapper, Captain Carpenter and the dog are still sitting round the dying campfire over the remains of supper. They are all looking a little bit bored. The dog has obviously been telling long reminiscences.

Dog

Another time when I was in Cairo, I was disguised as a water hydrant. The whole top part of my head had been removed and...

Carpenter

Please, Mr Salad .... you must tell us where Neutron is.

Dog

And I functioned! D'you hear? I really worked. I could put out a fire.

Carpenter

Please, Mr Salad...

Dog

Mind you, it hurt a bit...

Carpenter

Please, Mr Salad - there isn't much time. Where will we find Neutron?

Dog

OK. Give me another meatball and I'll tell you.

Carpenter grabs a meatball and throws it down for the dog. The dog wolfs it. Carpenter and Trapper exchange glances. Carpenter bends nearer the dog. The dog finishes the meatball with much slurping. Carpenter crouches beside him patiently.

Dog

OK listen carefully... I won't repeat this. You understand?

Carpenter

Yes yes - quick.

Dog

I know where Neutron is right now. I know the exact address and the exact house and the exact road...

Carpenter

OK where is he?

Dog

He's not in America...

Carpenter

No?

Dog

He's not in... Asia!

Dog

He's not in.., Australia!

Dog

He's in... Europe!

Carpenter

Yeah?

Dog

And you wanna know where in Europe?

Carpenter

Yeah!

Dog

OK. OK, I'll tell you. He's in England... In London... at Number 19...

A sudden explosion completely engulfs them. Cut to the supreme commander's offce. He is still nude and has an enormous display of talcs and powders on his desk. He is talking to the intercom.

Commander

OK. That's the Yukon - what's left?

Voice

Only Ruislip, the Gobi Desert, and your office, sir.

Commander

OK! Let's start with my office.

Commander

a big explosion

Cut to the Gobi Desert. Sweltering heat. We come onto a group opening a GPO box. There is a line of boxes stretching into the distance as far as the eye can see. Arabic is being spoken by the GPO official.

GPO Official

SUBTITLE: 'THIS NEW BOX COMPLETES THE ENCIRCLEMENT OF THE GOBI DESERT'

GPO Official

A terrific explosion. Cut to Neutron and Mrs Scum.

Mr Neutron

I will take you away from all this Mrs S.C.U.M.

Mrs Scum

Oh, Mr N... I'd follow you anywhere.

Mr Neutron

We will have two weeks in Benidorm.

Mrs Scum

Oh yes ... yes.

Mr Neutron

And I will make you the most beautiful woman in the world.

He stretches out his hands towards her. His piercing eyes narrow in concentration. There is a flash, a jump cut, and Mrs S stands before him as dumpy and unattractive as ever, but in a brand new C & A twin set and pearls, a nice new handbag, and a rather fussy hat.

Mrs Scum

Oh... it's beautiful... oh, Mr N, you have made my heart sing...

Mrs Scum

quick cut to stock film of bomber then back to Mrs Scum

Mrs Scum

quick flash of bomber then back to Mrs Scum

Mrs Scum

Life's rich harvest is being...

He takes her hand and pulls her away.

Mrs Scum

I'd better leave a note for Ken... he'll be expecting us...

SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'A MAN FROM THE "RADIO TIMES"'

Man

However, the Earth has been blown off its axis, and in a most dramatic and dangerous and expensive sequence, it spins off into space. There are appallingly expensive scenes of devastation and horror and the final incredibly expensive climax is reached as thousands of ape monsters in very expensive costumes descend from the sky onto these, plug up a whole city which has to be specially built and fling them all into the sea very expensively. And we can see those very expensive scenes right now.

Man

the credits start on his TV set

Man

Just after the credits have gone through... incidentally, these are going to be the most expensive and lavish scenes ever filmed by the BBC in conjunction with Time-Life of course ... these are some of the technical people who have been involved in filming these very expensive scenes, expensive sound, expensive visual effects there, expensive production assistant, expensive designer... cheap director. Well you can see those expensive scenes right now.

Conjurer

Good evening, last week we learned how to saw a lady in half. This week we're going to learn how to saw a lady into three bits and dispose of the body...

Two policemen chase him off the set. They run past the man from the previous announcement who is on the phone. On his TV set we see the policemen pursuing the conjurer.

Man

Look if you can put on rubbish like that, and 'Horse of the Year Show', you can afford us another minute, Mr Cotton, please, I mean look at this load of old...

CAPTION: 'A PARTY POLITICAL BROADCAST ON BEHALF OF THE LIBERAL PARTY'

Voice Over

There now follows a Party Political Broadcast on behalf of the Liberal Party...

Cut to a kitchen. Mr Garibaldi is eating a packet of 'Ano-Weet'. On the back of the packet in big letters it reads 'Free Inside - The Pope + Demonstration Record'. Kevin Garibaldi is stretched out the whole length of the sofa, eating a huge plate of baked beans. His father occasionally flaps the copy of the paper he is reading at him to clear the air. The paper is called 'The Scun' and has a pin-up on the front page with big headline 'What a Scorcher! Phew! Can Resist this Miss'; at the bottom of the page in small print 'China Declares War'. The banner across top reads 'In the Scun Today "Tits and Inflation"'. Ralph Garibaldi is sitting at the table eating. At one point he stretches across the table, and his arm sticks in the butter. He tries to clean it off and knocks the sugar over. There is a large photo of Ian Smith on the wall; built around it is a plaster shrine, with flowers in front of it. Mrs Garibaldi is ironing. She irons some underclothes, then she irons a transistor radio. Dotted about the room are a flat telephone, a flat standard lamp, and a flat cat. Valerie Garibaldi is wearing a shiny red miniskirt. She has bright yellow 'beehive' hair so stiffly lacquered that it is quite a hazard to various ornaments on the mantelpiece. She is continuously making herself up in the mantelpiece mirror which is shaped like a lavatory. The other member of the family is a very fat old dog. As we see all this, the football commentary is droning throughout on the radio.

Radio Voice

Pratt... back to Pratt... Pratt again... a long ball out to Pratt... and now Pratt is on the ball, a neat little flick back inside to Pratt, who takes it nicely and sends it through on the far side to Pratt, Pratt with it but passes instead to Pratt, Pratt again, oh and well intercepted by the swarthy little number nine, Concito Maracon. This twenty-one-year-old half back, remarkably stocky for 6' 3", square shouldered, balding giant, hair flowing in the wind, bright eyed, pert, young for his age but oh so old in so many ways. For a thirty-nine.year-old you wouldn't expect such speed. Normally considered slow, he's incredibly fast as he wanders aimlessly around, sweeping up and taking the defence to the cleaners. Who would have thought, though many expected it, that this remarkable forty-five-year-old, 9' 4" dwarf of a man, who is still only seventeen in some parts of the world, would ever really be ... Oh and there was a goal there apparently ... and now it's Pratt ... back to Pratt... Pratt again... a long ball to Pratt...

Radio Voice

crackle

By now mother has succeeded in flattening the radio with the iron. She folds it neatly and puts it on the pile.

Mr Garibaldi

I like this Ano-Weet, it really unclogs me.

Ralph Garibaldi knocks a bowl onto the floor. It smashes.

Mrs Garibaldi

Oh, do be careful.

Ralph Garibaldi

Sorry, mum.

Kevin opens another can of beans and pours them on to his plate, throwing the tin on the floor. The radio drones on.

Mr Garibaldi

I mean a lot of others say they unclog you, but I never had a single bowel movement with the 'Recto-Puffs'.

Ralph Garibaldi

Now if we ...

Ralph Garibaldi

he knocks the cereal box off the table

Ralph Garibaldi

Oh, sorry, mum ... Now if we lived in Rhodesia there'd be someone to mop that up for you.

Valerie Garibaldi

turning from the mirror in mid make-up

Valerie Garibaldi

Don't be so bleedin' stupid. If you lived in bleedin' Rhodesia, you'd be out at bleedin' fascist rallies every bleedin' day. You're a bleedin' racist, you bleedin' are.

Mr Garibaldi

Language!

Valerie Garibaldi

Well he gets on my sodding wick.

Mr Garibaldi

That's better.

Mother is now ironing the telephone and the cat. She irons them flat and pins them on the line.

Mr Garibaldi

No, the stuff I liked was that stuff they gave us before the war, what was it - Wilkinson's Number 8 Laxative Cereal. Phew. That one went through you like a bloody Ferrari...

The doorbell rings.

Mrs Garibaldi

Now, who's that at this time of day...

Mrs Garibaldi

she goes out

Mr Garibaldi

If it's the man to empty the Elsan, tell him it's in the hall.

Mrs Garibaldi

Right, dear.

Mr Garibaldi

And make sure that you hold it the right way up!

Ralph Garibaldi

Dad... ?

A middle-aged man appears from the broom cupboard.

Strange Man

Yeah?

Ralph Garibaldi

No no, my dad...

Strange Man

Oh...

Strange Man

he gets back into the cupboard again

Ralph Garibaldi

Dad? Why is Rhodesia called Rhodesia?...

Ralph Garibaldi

he knocks the teapot on to the floor, it smashes

Ralph Garibaldi

Oh sorry, dad.

Cut to the doorway in the hall. A man in a dark suit, very smart and well-dressed, is doing strange kung-fu antics.

Mrs Garibaldi

No... no, really, thank you very much... no, thank you for calling, not today, thank you. Good morning.

She shuts the door on him. As she does so Mr Garibaldi shouts out to her.

Mr Garibaldi

Who was that?

Mrs Garibaldi

coming in again

Mrs Garibaldi

now

Mrs Garibaldi

?

Ralph Garibaldi

he is standing beside the sink which has just split in two

Ralph Garibaldi

I was just washing up...

Mrs Garibaldi

Go and sit down!

Ralph Garibaldi

Mum? Do you know why Rhodesia's called Rhodesia?

Mr Garibaldi

Do you remember 'Go-Eazi'? They were hopeless...

Mr Garibaldi

Kevin opens another can of beans; dad notices in disgust and flaps his paper again

Mr Garibaldi

little black pellets... tasted foul and stuck inside you like flooring adhesive.

Valerie Garibaldi

she has finally finished her startling make-up

Valerie Garibaldi

Right, I'm off.

Mrs Garibaldi

When are you coming back tonight?

Valerie Garibaldi

3 a.m.

Mrs Garibaldi

I think it's disgusting... you a Member of Parliament.

Mr Garibaldi

I heard you in the hall last night, snogging away.

Valerie Garibaldi

I wasn't

Valerie Garibaldi

snogging

Valerie Garibaldi

!

Mr Garibaldi

Sounded like snogging to me. I could hear his great wet slobbering lips going at yer ... and his hand going up yer...

Mrs Garibaldi

Dad!

Strange Man

coming out of the cupboard

Strange Man

Yes.

Mrs Garibaldi

No ... not you.

Strange Man

Oh!

Strange Man

he goes back in again

Mrs Garibaldi

Just mind your language...

Ralph knock a leg off the table. It collapses entirely.

Ralph Garibaldi

Oh, sorry, mum.

Kevin Garibaldi

too fat and flatulent to get up

Kevin Garibaldi

I've run out of beans!

Valerie Garibaldi

We was talking, we was not snogging.

Mr Garibaldi

Talking about snogging, I'll bet...

The phone rings. Mrs Garibaldi answers it.

Valerie Garibaldi

If you must know, we was talking about Council re-housing.

Mrs Garibaldi

on the phone

Mrs Garibaldi

Would it mean going to live in Hollywood?

Kevin Garibaldi

desperate but unable to move

Kevin Garibaldi

I run out of beans!

Mr Garibaldi

Where to re-house his right hand, that's what he was interested in!

Mrs Garibaldi

And has Faye Dunaway definitely said yes?

Valerie Garibaldi

He is the Chairman of the Housing sub-committee.

The bell rings.

Mr Garibaldi

Snogging sub-committee, more like...

Mrs Garibaldi

Ralph, do answer that door will you!

Kevin Garibaldi

Beans!!

Mrs Garibaldi

Shut up!!

Ralph Garibaldi

Yea, mum.

Mr Garibaldi

shouting to Ralph

Mr Garibaldi

If it's the man from the Probbo-Rib, tell him it's in the bed.

Ralph gets up. As he goes he knocks the leg off the old-fashioned gas cooker. It falls to one side bringing down shelves next to it, plates, crockery and a section of the wall revealing the hallway the other side.

Kevin Garibaldi

roaring

Kevin Garibaldi

Beans! Beans!

Mrs Garibaldi

Shut up!

A man in a Tarzan outfit, except with a postman's hat and a little mailbag, swings in on a liana shouting a jungle yell.

Postman

Postman-a-a-n!!

A gong sounds. They all stop acting.

Cut to stock film of ladies applauding.

Pull out from this stock film to see that it is on a screen in a presentation studio. A glittery compère is also applauding sycophantically at his desk, about which is the glittery slogan 'Most Awful Family in Britain, 1974. Sponsored by Heart Attacko Margarine'.

Presenter

A very good try there, by the Garibaldi family of Droitwich in Worcestershire. Professor...

Pull out further to pick up a panel of three distinguished rather academic looking people.

Professor

Well, I can't make up my mind about this family... I don't think there was the sustained awfulness that we really need. I mean, the father was appalling...

Two other members of the panel nod vigorous agreement.

Lady Organs

Appalling... yes ....

Professor

He was dirty, smelly and distasteful ... and I liked him very much ... but...

Presenter

Lady Organs?

Lady Organs

Well ... they were an unpleasant family certainly, but I don't think we had enough of the really gross awfulness that we're looking for...

Presenter

Well, harsh words there for the Garibaldi family of Droitwich in Worcestershire, at present holders of the East Midlands Most Awful Family Award - Lower Middle-Class Section but unable today to score more than fifteen on our disgustometer. Well with the scores all in from the judges, the Garibaldis are number three ... and a surprise number two ... the Fanshaw-Chumleighs of Berkshire...

Presenter

he turns to the screen

A very elegant breakfast table in beautifully tasteful surroundings. Four upper-class folk - two woman (Michael and Graham) and two men (Eric and Terry J) - are talking most incredibly loudly at each other, with quite appalling accents. An appalling din altogether. They talk just about at the same time as each other.

First Person

What a super meal.

Second Person

Absolutely super. Pat and Max are coming down from Eton to help daddy count money.

Third Person

How absolutely super.

Fourth Person

My man at Poirer's says I could have my whole body lifted for £5,500

First Person

How super...

First Person

etc.

Cut back to the panel nodding thoughfully.

Presenter

Well, some of the wonderful behaviour that made the Fanshaw-Chumleighs the second Most Awful Family in Britain 1974. But the winners, by a clear ten point margin, are once again the awful Jodrell family of Durham. Unfortunately, we're not allowed to show you some of the performance that won them an award, but I assure you it was of the very highest standard, was it not, Lady Organs?

Lady Organs

Oh, yes, superb ... Mr Jodrell - you know, the old grandfather, who licks the ...

Presenter

hurriedly

Presenter

Yes, yes...

Lady Organs

He's superb. His gobbing is consistent and accurate. His son is a dirty foul little creature, and those frightful scabs which Mrs Jodrell licks off the cat are...

Presenter

during this speech we cut to the same image on a TV screen

Presenter

Well, thank you very much, Lady Organs ... and from all of us all, well done to the Jodrells ... and to all of you, not forgetting those of you who may be halfway in between, without whom, of course, and not forgetting who made it all possible, when, and we'll be back, until then and so it's goodnight from me and here's wishing you a safe journey home, thank you for watching this show, don't forget it was all great fun, I've enjoyed it, and I hope you watching at home have enjoyed it too.

He is switched off, and fades into a dot. Pull back to reveal that the TV which has just been switched off is in a dirty old sitting room in which all the characters are really unpleaant pepperpots. They are dressed more or less identically, except that son has a school cap and a blazer over his pepperpot gear. He has a satchel and National Health glasses. The father has moustache and glasses and a Fair-Isle jersey.

Mother

The Jodrells win every bloody year... makes you vomit ... dad?

Dad

Yes?

Mother

Get your stinking feet off the bread.

Dad

I'm only wiping the cat's do's off.

Son

Mum?

Mother

Shut yet face, Douglas.

Son

I wanted some corn-plasters.

Mother

Shut up and eat what you got.

A cat set into the wall, i.e. a glove puppet, screeches as if someone had pulled its tail outside.

Dad

she slaps it; it expires

She takes a couple of milk bottles out. Standing on the doorstep is a man with a Nordic accent in female national costume. He has a tray labeled 'Icelandic Honey Week'

Man

A strong hive of bees contains approximately 75,000 bees. Each honey bee must make 154 trips to collect one teaspoon of honey. Hello, sir.

Dad

What do you want?

Man

Would you like to buy some of our honey, sir?

Mother

What you doing in here?

Man

Which would you like, the Californian Orange Blossom, the Mexican, the New Zealand, or the Scottish Heather?

Mother

He can't eat honey. It makes him go plop plops.

Man

Come on, please try some.

Dad

All right I'll have some Icelandic Honey.

Man

No, there is no such thing.

Dad

You mean you don't make any honey at all?

Man

No, no, we must import it all. Every bally drop. We are a gloomy people. It's so crikey cold and dark up there, and only fish to eat. Fish and imported honey. Oh strewth!

Mother

Well why do you have a week?

Man

Listen Buster! In Reykyavik it is dark for eight months of the year, and it's cold enough to freeze your wrists off and there's only golly fish to eat. Administrative errors are bound to occur in enormous quantities. Look at this - it's all a mistake. It's a real pain in the sphincter! Icelandic Honey Week? My Life!

Mother

Well why do you come in here trying to flog the stuff, then?

Man

Listen Cowboy. I got a job to do. It's a stupid, pointless job but at least it keeps me away from Iceland, all right? The leg of the worker bee has...

They slam the door on him. Someone rather like Jeremy Thorpe looks round the door and waves as they do so.

THE US CAVALRY WERE DRAWN UP AT FORT WORTH, AND THE SCENE WAS SET FOR THE FINAL ALL OUT ONSLAUGHT THAT COULD SET THE NEW TERRITORIES ABLAZE'

Cut to a doctor's surgery. It has a wall shrine with a photo of Christiaan Barnard with flowers and candles in front of it. The doctor is talking to an embarrassed-looking man.

Doctor

Well, Mr Cotton, you have what we in the medical profession call a naughty complaint. My advice to you is to put this paper bag over your head - it has little holes there for your eyes, you see - and to ring this bell, and to take this card along to your hospital.

Doctor

he hands him card three feet long which reads 'For Special Treatment'

Doctor

the man hands him over wad of fivers

Doctor

the man gets up to go

Doctor

he picks up big text book entitled 'Medical Practice' and flicks through the pages

Doctor

Hmm.,. hmm ... Hippocratic oath ... it's not in there ... jolly good. Very useful. Next!

An out-of-vision scream. A man staggers in clutching his bleeding stomach. Lots of blood pours out of him throughout the scene.

Doctor

Ah, yes you must be Mr Williams.

Williams

obviously fatally wounded

Williams

Y... yes...

Doctor

Well, do take a seat. What seems to be the trouble?

Williams

I've... I've just been stabbed by your nurse...

Doctor

Oh dear.... well I'd probably better have a look at you then. Could you fill in this form first?

Doctor

he hands him a form

Williams

She just stabbed me...

Doctor

Yes. She's an unpredictable sort. Look, you seem to be bleeding rather badly. I think you'd better hurry up and fill in that form.

Williams

Ahhh ... couldn't ... I ... do ... it ... later, doctor!

Doctor

No, no. You'd have bled to death by then. Can you hold a pen?

Williams

I'll try.

With great effort he releases one of his hands from his bleeding stomach.

Doctor

Yes, it's a hell of a nuisance all this damn paperwork, really it is...

Doctor

he gets up and strolls around fairly unconcerned

Doctor

it's a real nightmare, this damned paperwork. It really is a hell of a nuisance. Something ought to be done about it.

Williams

Do I have to answer all the questions, doctor?

Doctor

No, no, no, just fill in as many as you can - no need to go into too much detail. I don't know why we bother with it all, really, it's such a nuisance. Well let's see how you've done, then...

Doctor

Williams half collapses

Doctor

Oh dear oh dear... that's not very good, is it. Look, surely you knew number four!

Williams

No ... I didn't...

Doctor

It's from 'The Merchant of Venice' - even I know that!

Williams

bleeding profusely

Williams

It's going on the carpet, doctor.

Doctor

Oh don't worry about that! Look at this - number six - the Treaty of Versailles, Didn't you know that? Oh, my God.

Williams

Ahgg... aghhh.

Doctor

And number nine - Emerson Fittipaldi!

Doctor

gives Williams a look

Doctor

Virginia Wade? You must be mad!

The nurse enters with a smoking revolver.

Nurse

Oh doctor, I've just shot another patient. I don't think there's any point in your seeing him.

Doctor

You didn't

Doctor

kill

Doctor

him, did you?

Nurse

'Fraid so.

Doctor

You mustn't

Doctor

them, nurse.

Nurse

Oh, I'm sorry doctor. It was just on the spur of the moment. Rather silly really.

She exits, taking a sword from the wall. Through the next bit of the scene we hear screams off.

Williams

I'm sorry about the carpet, doctor.

Doctor

Mr Williams, I'm afraid I can't give you any marks, so I won't be able to recommend you for hospital. Tell you what - I'll stop the bleeding - but strictly speaking I shouldn't even do that on marks like these...

The nurse enters covered in blood.

Nurse

There are no more patients now, doctor.

Doctor

Oh well, let's go and have lunch, then.

Nurse

What about... er...

Nurse

she points to Williams who is lying on the floor gurgling by this time

Doctor

Ah yes - look, Mr Williams we're just popping out for a bite of lunch while we've got a spare moment, you know. Look, have another bash at the form... and if at least you can answer the question on history right, then we may be able to give you some morphine or something like that, OK?

Williams

Thank you, doctor, thank you.

Cut to a large country house sitting more, dominated by large grinning portrait of Jeremy Thorpe. A bishop is sitting at a desk, typing. A brigadier in full military uniform just to below the chest, then a patch of bare midriff, with belly button showing, then a lavender tutu, incredibly hairy leg, thick army socks and high heels, is dictating.

Brigadier

Dear Sir, I wish to protest in the strongest possible terms. Yours sincerely, Brigadier N. F. Marwood-Git (retired). Read that back, will you, Brian.

Bishop

And when he had built up Cedron, he sent Horsemen there, and an host of footmen to the end that issuing out they might make outroads upon the ways of Judea, as the King commanded them...

Brigadier

Good! Pop it in an envelope and bung it off! It's no good bottling these things up, Brian. If you feel them you must say them or you'll just go mad...

Bishop

Oh yes indeed ... as the book of Maccabee said ... Ye as the flea is like unto an oxen, so is the privet hedge liken unto a botanist black in thy sight, O Lord!

Brigadier

Quite... Look why don't you just nip out for lunch, Brian...

Bishop

Yea ... as Raymond Chandler said, it was one of those days when Los Angeles felt like a rock-hard fig.

Brigadier

Brian, let's stop this pretending, shall we.

Bishop

Oh... ye... as Dirk Bogarde said in his autobiography...

Brigadier

Brian... let's stop all this futile pretence... I've... I've always been moderately fond of you...

Bishop

Well to be quite frank, Brigadier ... one can't walk so closely with a chap like you for... for so long without... feeling something deep down inside, even if it isn't anything... anything ... very much.

Brigadier

Well, splendid... Brian... er... well I don't suppose there's much we can do, really.

Bishop

Not on television ... no...

Brigadier

No... they ... they are a lot more permissive these days than they used to be...

Bishop

Ah yes... but not with this sort of thing...

Brigadier

No ... I suppose they've ... got to draw the line somewhere...

Bishop

Yes...

Brigadier

Well take a letter, Brian. Dear Sir, I wish to protest...

Sir Pratt

I know it's only human to say, 'Oh this will never happen to me', and of course, it won't. I'm asking you, please, please, send no contributions, however large, to me.

We see the last bit on a TV in Mrs What- a- long- name- this- is- hardly- worth- typing- but- never- mind- it- doesn't- come- up- again's living- room. Ding-dong of doorbell. A cupboard door opens, and the middle-aged man we saw in first scene comes out. He has no iguana on his shoulder.

Mrs Long Name

She turns it off. The TV set just folds up as if empty and collapses on to the floor. Dust rises. She goes into the hallway to the front door (singing 'Anything Goes' by the other Cole Porter to herself) and opens it. A man with a briefcase stands there.

Mr Vernon

Hello, madam...

Mr Vernon

Mrs Long Name

Ah hello... you must have come about...

Mr Vernon

Yes, dear?

Girl's Voice

I've just had another baby.

Mr Vernon

Oh, no! How many's that now?

Girl's Voice

Cut to exterior of Mrs Long Name's house. She comes out and sets off purposefully up the road, passing four pepperpot nannies digging up the road. They are wearing the usual slippers, paisley dresses and knotted handkerchief. One wears a helmet. One works a pneumatic drill. She is stripped to the waist wearing a big pink bra. Behind, heroic shots of Mrs Long Name walking out of town, through suburbs, into neat country, then into wilder country. She finally stops in close up, and looks up with inspiration in her eyes.

Cut to a linkman standing before Stonehenge.

Linkman

This is Stonehenge ... and it's from here we go to Africa.

Jeremy Thorpe appears at the edge of shot and waves.

Cut to an as overgrown, jungleoid location as Torquay can provide. A very big thick tree in the foreground. David Attenborough pushes through jungle towards camera. He has damp sweat patches under his arms which grow perceptibly during the scene. He has two African guides in the background both with saxophones round their neck.

Attenborough

slapping the side of a tree

Attenborough

a native whispers in his ear

Attenborough

Oh, super ... well, I've just been told that this is not in fact the legendary walking tree of Dahomey, this is one of Africa's many stationary trees, Arborus Barnbet Gaseoignus. In fact we've just missed the walking tree... it left here at eight o'clock this morning... was heading off in that direction... so we'll see if we can go and catch it up. Come on boys.

They move off. At this point we notice that there are two other saxophone-wearing natives, a trumpeter, a trombonist, a double bassist, a guitarist, and finally a man with a drum kit tied to his back. Mix through to them on the move in another pan of the jungle. Sweat is now spraying out from under Attenborough's armpits as if from a watering can.

Attenborough

Well, we're still keeping up with it, but it's setting a furious pace. Early this morning we thought we'd spotted it, but it turned out to be an Angolan sauntering tree, Amazellus Robin Ray, out walking with a Gambian Sidling Bush...

Attenborough

Jeremy Thorpe leans in the background and waves to camera

Attenborough

Rupert the bearer points excitedly

Attenborough

they move off, by this time waterspray is gushing out from all over his chest

Attenborough

But, what Rupert had in fact discovered was something very different...

He stops him, they kneel down. Cut to their eyeline. In the distance, amongst low bushes and thick undergrowth, six Africans dressed immaculately in cricket gear having a game of cricket. Cut to Attenborough, Rupert and one other bearer watching. Attenborough is looking down at something he is holding. The other two are gazing wide-eyed at the cricketers.

Attenborough

The Turkish Little Rude Plant.

Attenborough

he holds up, carefully and wondrously, a plant which has green outer leaves splayed back to reveal a small, accurately sculpted bum

Attenborough

Rupert nudges him and points excitedly at the batsmen

Attenborough

Attenborough points, apparently at the batsmen, but he has clearly got it wrong again

Attenborough

Rupert nudges him again

Cut to an animated professor.

Voice

No, what they had come across was a tribe lost to man since time immemorial... the legendary Batsmen of the Kalahari...

Voice

cut to a shot of natives playing cricket

Voice Over

Primitive customs still survive here as if the march of time had passed them by. But for all the mumbo-jumbo and superstition, the Batsmen of the Kalahari are formidable fighters, as we can see on this rare footage of them in action against Warwickshire.

Cut to a big county ground pavilion in mid-shot. We zoom in on the commentator on a balcony.

Commentator

Warwickshire had dismissed the Kalahari Batsmen for 140, and then it was their turn to face this extraordinary Kalahari attack. Pratt was the first to go, but Pratt and Pratt put on a second wicket stand of nought, which was broken by Odinga in his most hostile mood.

A compilation of the day's play. Natives in normal cricket gear. Pratt at crease as per usual cricket coverage. Cut to a low shot of the bowler thundering up towards the wicket. Cut away to the batsman preparing to take the shot. Cut back to the bowler. As he reaches the crease he produces a spear and raises it to shoulder height and hurls it. Cut to batsman who is hit full in the stomach. His bat dislodges the bails. There is a 'howzat' from all the native fielders. He makes an annoyed gesture as if he were Colin Cowdrey caught clean bowled, and sinks to the ground.

CAPTION: 'B. RATT'

Thats B. Pratt, hit wicket - 0. But Pratt and Z. Pratt dug in and took the score to a half...

Nine O'clock News intro in the newsroom behind. Behind the newsreader several men including Jeremy Thorpe are drinking and celebrating. A woman is dancing on the table.

Newsreader

Good evening. Over 400,000 million pounds were wiped off the value of shares this afternoon, when someone in the Stock Exchange coughed. Sport: capital punishment is to be re-introduced in the first and second division. Any player found tackling from behind or controlling the ball with the lower part of the arm will be hanged. But the electric chair remains the standard punishment for threatening the goalie. Referee's chairman, Len Goebbels said 'at last the referee has been given teeth'. Finally, politics: the latest opinion poll published today shows Labour ahead with 40%, the AA second with 38% and not surprisingly Kentucky Fried Chicken running the Liberals a very close third. And now back to me. Hello. And now it's time to go over to Hugh Delaney in Paignton.

Cut to the linkman on the pier at Paignton. A smallish crowd is gathered behind him including Jerermy Thorpe who waves at the camera from the back.

Linkman

Hello and welcome to Paignton, because it's from Paignton that we take you straight back to the studio.

Cut to a man in swimming trunks and a snorkel pushed back on his head standing in the studio holding a stuffed polecat on a pole.

Man

Hello. And it's from here we go over there.

Cut to the 'Most Awful Family' presenter.

Presenter

Well we're already here so let's go over there.
