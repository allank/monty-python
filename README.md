# Monty Python Data

An attempt at converting the scripts from [http://www.ibras.dk/montypython/justthewords.htm](http://www.ibras.dk/montypython/justthewords.htm) into a more structured format.

If all you want is the converted data, grab the `merged.xlsx` file.

If you're wanting to use this code to learn web scraping, you're probably best off going somewhere else - the code is horrible, but it works (mostly).

> Remember, buy Whizzo butter and this dead crab.

With the dialogue, you can generate new _Python-ish_ lines.

> Yeah, er, I, I personally think this is getting too silly.
